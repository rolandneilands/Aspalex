Regional Differences

Different countries may emphasise the symbolism of months and festivals to varying amounts, or may have completely different cultural meanings for them.

Plane of Water:

Does not celebrate Emberwake, rather “Storm’s Eye” – a moment of peace to repair,  take stock, give thanks and prepare.

Plane of Fire:

Does not tolerate mention of Frostcoil, instead they stage the “Freedom Race” where all slaves may race to win their freedom, at risk of longer service.
