Session Summaries

Corus Vale Campaign canon lore.

These events happened as recorded in Salmur’s leather bound journal and the retellings of thethe player characters who bore witness. Bahamut knows not all may have seen it this way, and events have a way of changing in each telling, especially if it’s the rogues or bards telling it …

Session 0

Salmur’s notes date back to the Greymoor army days. Lots of boredom, with occasional moments of violence. This brought him no closer to finding either his birth or adopted families, or justice for them.

He helped organise and defend a small town from kobolds after this, and with some friends traced them back to a lair. The leader escaped through a portal, and Salmur jumped through too, only to find him nowhere to be seen, and Salmur suddenly in a fighting ring in a small town tavern - where he knew nobody at all …

Session 1

Date: X

Introduction: Started in small trading post known as The Crossing. 

Aesir & Aeris met NPC Salmur Kalfrex (an overly evangelical dragonborn paladin) in the tavern (owned by Bunt) who was fighting in bout organised by Jolly Jon.


After they rescued local girl Vella from some pixies the party were offered permanent residence with her mother the local washerwoman Gemma, who took particular efforts cleaning Aeris (who possibly may not have bathed in years).

Date X +1

They took a bounty from Joff the mayor/sheriff ( Merriff?) for reclaiming a missing caravan nearby. Wolves were seen picking at the bandit corpses. 

Date X +2

Returned missing caravan and goods, including the Swearing Sword Rebolon to Summerhaim to Lord Ayles who granted it to Zeb the Ranger (NPC). Zeb accompanied the party back to pick up the weapons cache from the caravan for the war against the Orcs, who ambushed the party along the way and apparently may have multiple clans working together.

Date X +4

The party found and adopted orphaned wolf pups. At the war camp Summerhaim warrior trainer Sippervetak then granted Toughness feat to the party and pups. Zeb remains at Summerhaim to fight the orcs. Salmur swears an Oath of Vengeance against those who oppress the weak. Aesir notes not to annoy him and the party note they are all orphans.

Date X+10

Cloudmother:

Aesir wanted to climb Cloudmother despite his allergy to sunlight so the party took a caravan to Weyrhold. Here Aesir gains a Githyanki NPC follower Aplex Tarrant who wants to find the Underdark (where Aesir fails to hide that he is from) and claims to be a knight. After buying weather-appropriate gear the party climb the ridgeline. They were ambushed by a Korred, who spectacularly failed to control a summoned earth elemental (who can destroy the earth it hides in) and had a stash of magic shields and weapons. Its hair turns out to be a very useful rope.

Date X+15

Session 2

Visiting the Cloud Giants at Boomtown next we discover the magic shields were intended for them as scale mail pieces and in return were well received by Bogo their leader and spent a night on his couch watched by his "little" pets (mountain lion & giant eagle). Bogo guarantees the party calm weather for the ascent.

Date X+16

On the side of Cloudmother we find the monastery Aster La who welcome the party although are quite unnerved by the gith Aplex. Aeris decides to take a monk level and trains here in the Way of the Astral Self with the Kwan Hsui Lama. The rest of the party ascends to find a Ki'rin at the summit. The draconic angel Ki'rin advises that Corus Vale is under attack from all sides, which they already know, and needs powerful magic items to survive. They take this new quest to heart.

Date X+20

Returning to Aster La while Aeris trains, the party track some Duergar into an ancient barrow turned evil by an unknown necromancer. As a party of "clankers" they are not subtle or thorough in their cleanout even with the initial help of some monk initiates, one of whom is an Aarakochra, and led by the Rimpoche Lompok (Aster La's 2IC).

Date X+23

On the way back to Weyrhold they are ambushed by a young white dragon in a snowbank. Bogo welcomes them back at Boomtown.

They also find the Korred corpse infested by Red Caps.

Date X+25

Weyrhold:

At Weyrhold they receive a heroes welcome and are all knighted by Lord Meith. Salmur quietly disapproves of cardsharp newcomer Bigtoe including himself in this ceremony. Aplex quietly says "again!".

Date X+26

Lightning Falls:

The party announce to all invited they will investigate nearby Lightning Falls, rumoured home of a dragon. Sippervetak, known from Summerhaim, is in town to train warriors for an anticipated attack from the Great Sand in the south and tells the party to visit him on their return.

Session 3

Jeff and John follow the self-proclaimed heroes in search of epic songworthy adventure and inadvertently drop into dragon-breath melted air vents. John finds a shared history with Aeris in the Moon druid circle led by Twenzel Farsight.

The party battle some seriously challenging monsters in the caverns, including Chimaera, Bodak, Babau, a Drider, Drow, a Flameskull and a Roper, while struggling to find how to work together. Jeff wanders off into new rooms and conflicts before resolving current ones, possibly to increase the epicness. Aplex the Gith rabidly destroys a mindflayer despite the party attempting diplomacy.

A magical statue proclaims a prophecy after 3 riddles were solved: "Corus Vale, assailed on all sides. Friends and enemies are not what they seem. The old dark scaly one awakes at last.".

The party finds a hidden chest laden with treasure thanks to Big Toe and drag it through multiple battles until they meet a drow (named Emmersatz) speaking Common who offers to help but immediately attempts to drag the chest away mid battle and is only stopped temporarily by Tasha's Hideous Laughter.

What will they do next? ...

Session 4

The story continues;

Some new party members tag in while others rest to recover hit points and spell slots. Leon the paladin, Aargh the hitter of things and Thoric the cleric join, and allow the suspect drow Emmersatz to join on a (verbose) contract basis. Emmersatz says the tunnels to the south go all the way under the mountains to the south.

Date X+27

They cleave through snake-people, and then find another earth elemental, which John knows is resistant to ordinary weapons but can't tell the party while in bear shape.

The party ignore a scratched warning to "stay left" and are nearly drained by a wraith who fades into the walls, only to be found on the other side by Emmersatz and later Leon. Thoric learns to hit first before turning undead.

The party regroup and sleep (not elves) Emmersatz wanders off. The party doesn't wait and finds a camp of blue kobolds in a large cavern hidden behind the waterfall. The kobolds let slip their dragon patron has not been around for some time and might be in the Great Sand to the south with its kin. The kobolds attempt to swarm the party but are exterminated by Thoric.

The party searches the cave and high alcoves but find nothing. Emmersatz appears from an alcove with 1k GP and a black scale helmet.

Thoric tries to identify it and finds it is +2AC, with multiple unknown mostly beneficial permanent enchantments. To attune fully the wielder will need to kill a specific creature wearing it.

Leon puts the helmet on and feels immediately more powerful. Thoric offers to try it, but Leon does but then doesn't want to take it off.

In their next rest he has strange dreams of being a lord over dragons and walking through pools of acid unharmed ...

Date X+28

Session 5

The party rest before dividing the loot in the dungeon at the request of Emmersatz who doesn't want to go up into the sun. He wanders off again in the night, coming back in the morning. Leon attempts to attune to his new favourite helmet while dreaming about riding dragons and finds out more, including that he will have to kill a drow to attune to it. The 2 drow characters find him looking at them sideways in the morning.

Thoric identifies the remaining items a the loot is split. Aeris casts detect magic on Emmersatz despite his objections, and finds he is under several long running transmutation spells. Emmersatz leaves with his share and offers to help them find shiny treasures if they ever come back to the 'dark.

Return to Weyrhold:

The party return to Weyrhold where Sippervetak congratulates them on confirming the dragon is gone. He provisions all with warhorses and squires, and trains the party in the feat Mounted Combatant over a week. The heroes equip themselves better, and Big Toe finally has his trick dice custom made with a tip for silence.

Date X+35

Tabaxi scouts are seen outside the city, and our new cavalry answer the call, and notice some well covered tracks. Virtu casts Fly on his horse, and proceeds to make loud feline taunts. Yowling from the hill gives away the position of a scout party. Virtu divebombs their minstrel at the risk of being pincushioned with bolts, losing concentration mid-air and falling through a tree as the dismounted party close in up the steep hill behind the scouts.

The cat skirmishers fight an organised rearguard action backwards up the hill, and almost evade our determined squad.

The party return to Weyrhold to warn Lord Meith, who doubles the patrols.

Where next? They've heard the mage Mayber Von Tollant at Goldspire makes magic items ...

Date X+36

Session 6

The party relaxes and enjoys some entertainment. Jeff the bard composes something for the ages with "The Quest for the Dragon of Lightning Falls" in which the party assist Jeff in said Quest. New Tabaxi friend of Big Toe, Teririst is found inserting his name in another song. Songs of the parties deeds, Lord Meith and a war anthem fill out the set list. Tabaxi slander jingles are wisely cut despite a ripe audience.

Standing room only is available at shows at the Golden Eagle and the Six Legged Lion with enthusiastic professional-in-other-ways backup dancers. The concerts were promoted as a benefit to find missing children locally. The best lead on the children may be an old woman on a hillside to the west.

Date X+37

Session 7

Leon, Aarg and Virtu take it on themselves to find some missing children. Aarg searching the hillside forest near the forest by charging through it and yelling along with some Tarzan like tree swinging earns some tittering applause from unseen watchers in the trees.

Aarg spots a possible den under a rock overhang and the party approach. Virtu makes out some dire wolves in the cave just as the rest of the pack hits Aarg from the side. Despite some heavy early hits the wolves are put down. No trace of human bones is found in the den.

Some pixies reveal themselves impressed and amused by Aarg and mention the children may have gone to see an old woman up the hill.

The party find Aunty Agatha who offers them frog stew and trade in secrets and denies any knowledge of the children's whereabouts, although admits to trading secrets with them.

She reveals Leon is wearing the Helm of Halva, an ancient Dragonborn warlord who was known to ride the black dragon Sapzelnon and was honoured enough to have a full suit of armour made from the hide of one of his kin.

The party rest in Agathas hut, unwisely not posting a guard. A storm rolls over and Leon wakes in the middle of the night to find himself paralysed.

The sleeping party is hit by Cones of Cold repeatedly, with Leon and Virtu only saved from becoming ice statues by the pixies bravely/recklessly distracting the bheur hag, two of whom become ice statues along with Virtus pseudodragon familiar.

The sight of her feasting on the pixies strikes fear into the heart of half the heroes.

Agatha hops on her graystaff and launches into the air, but is Commanded to land by Leon, and javelined by Aarg.

An illusion is lifted as she dies revealing a more rooms at the back of the hut with 2 of the 3 children imprisoned and some healing potions and a scroll.

The surviving children are returned to their overjoyed parents.

Date X+38

Session 8

Leon dreams of a blue dragon playing chess against a red dragon over a board with human and Tabaxi pieces.

  
Goldspire:

The party decide to travel to Goldspire to answer the call for "research assistants". Goldspire is surrounded by large amounts of the 4 elements; earth, air, fire and water and some mixtures of these. They have a Master of each element, with a number of acolytes, all led by Mayber Von Tollant.

Mayber and the Fire Master demonstrate the "mini-gate" devices being constructed which open 6" sluices for material from the inner planes like fire, water and wind. The party agree to work as "Gate Keepers" to clear blockages from the far ends of the mini-gates.

Date X+39

The Plane of Air:

Starting with the Plane of Air on some borrowed flying brooms the party float into an open expanse with only some large and long trees stretching into the distance where the wind increases.

Locating object gives them a bead on the gates on the 2nd closest tree in sight. Moving to the trunk they avoid some suspicious twig and vine creatures and greet some friendly Coautls. A pair of air elementals are easy work, before they find a manticore nest on the mini-gates. Mutual threats lead to more manticores appearing and a pitched battle. Some shiny objects are found while moving the nest off the gates and the party head back.

A young black dragon races to cut them off and reclaim Leons black scaly helm, and Leon sprints to make it through the gate home, only to have the dragon follow him, breathe acid a 3rd time at Leon, and die dramatically in front of the very impressed mage tower staff.

Date X+40

Session 9

Returning briefly to the dragon's lair some art of real value is found, including a jade chess set with golden human and Tabaxi pieces.

Revelations:

The party recount their previous dragon encounters and songs, which they are nonplussed to find Mayber amused by. He says "You do know that Emmersatz is the name of the blue dragon of Lightning Falls don't you?"

He names some of the other dragons of local legend and history and the party find they also know Sippervetak, a red dragon fond of war and training warriors.

Mayber offers to give the party the greater challenge of placing new mini-gates in appropriate places for either gold or a device.

Date X+41

Session 10

The Plane of Water:

Leon, Aesir, Big Toe, Thoric, Teririst and Aplex venture into the Plane of Water with borrowed cloaks of the Manta Ray.

After some time getting their bearings and finding a way to navigate in the dark depths, they succeed in dropping half their minigates into a deep ocean trench. Returning to their entry point they find a floating green island.

Investigation shows it to be a gargantuan dragon turtle called Wixalixa, who Big Toe is able to talk to and convince to carry them several days closer to the mud pools bordering the Plane of Earth in exchange for a good debarnacling and general parasite removal.

Most sea creatures leave them alone as they cruise on turtleback, apart from some steam mephits.

Wixalixa casually mentions an undersea domed city exists below them along the way. He navigates skillfully through the currents and reefs of an archipelago and stops at the shallows near a marshy estuary.

As they're about to part ways, Wixalixa warns in alarm of them of an approaching kraken. The two leviathans battle fiercely and deal massive amounts of damage to each other and the party. Wixalixa is thrown through the air and the party leap into squidblack water or onto the kraken itself.

The party barely stagger away from a belly up kraken floating in its own ink and we leave them resting on a dragon turtles back for one last night.

Date X+44

Session 11

The party feast on cartwheel sized calamari, as does Wixalixa and a surprisingly orderly queue of sharks. They collect some ink via minigate and the beak. 

  
Above them an airship spirals out of control, attacked by three green dragons. A red dragon ridden by a githyanki desperately defends it as it crashes down behind a nearby island. Investigation shows it capsized with no survivors, other than a githyanki pilot called Xad. The red dragon Exaroff and one green dragon also died in the raid, leaving two greens unaccounted for. Xad recounts being chased by the greens through several more planar gates than the astral skiff could sustain, burning out its gate engine. The skiff Aspalex has a nautiloid sentience which is thrashing in pain, mast augured into the mud with massive damage. Xad, Thoric and Aplex calm it down and begin healing/repairing. They persuade Wixalixa to pull the mast out of the muddy seafloor and right the ship in exchange for a story. Xad describes his narrow escape from the green dragons, and Aplex his final day as a creche guard being overrun by mindflayers.

Thoric proves to be uniquely suited to be a liveship-wright and repairs what he can. He finds several structural pieces of filigree silver something like Aplex's sword and some large wooden shards are needed to repair the rudder and boom. The wood is replaced with local palm and mangrove, but locating the silver requires tracking through the swamp below the descent path. Some large crabs prove aggressive and unwillingly provide dinner before the silver is located and the mini-gates dropped in the mud successfully. This allows the makeshift repairs to Aspalex to be completed over several days, launching it again and making it serviceable with the sails. The astral engine needs some serious repairs still. 

The party send Aplex back to Goldspire to report, and ask for assistance. The mages suggest crystals of particular kind called Leyden, or lightning crystals, are required. Mayber thinks they can perhaps can be found on the plane of Earth, or the ice floes of Water.

Date X+47

Session 12

An outcast high elf named Thorion, marooned on the plane of water and getting sick of eating fish sees the airship from a distance and makes his way over to it in time to see the green dragons and gate. Draco, Xaderos and Aplex welcome him to the expedition, and the airship cruises over the swamps and mud foothills to the Plane of Earth. They ambush and subdue a young blue dragon, and are themselves nearly ambushed at night in the mountains by a drow party led by a drider. The drider curls up into a ball as Thorion hits it with a final arrow, and barrels down the cliffside, knocking him and Aplex off the ledge and luckily onto Aspalex's deck where Xad thoughtfully positioned him. The airship cruises on, up the mountain ranges toward a mountain so big it dwarfs the rest. Some earth elementals offer to dig them a tunnel to the City of Jewels in exchange for an airship ride. The airship lurches precariously as Grog, Bog and Krog all lean over the same edge like eager tourists. Balancing them out, we continue on to the foot of Mt Fundus, where angry fist shaking is done at some hill giants, before setting down in an elemental approved valley. The 3 elementals part the stone into a tunnel at a steep angle towards the City of Jewels, pausing only to eat a few geodes along the way. Arriving at the city, a pair of Dao (earth genie) guards charge a 2gem entry to point out the bazaar and warn that fighting will not be tolerated, unless it's quick. The cavernous city of bridges and columns beckons, lit by luminous crystals and glow worms ...

Date X+52


Session 13

The party enter the City of Jewels at what the Dao refer to as '2 o'clock, level 2'. Inside a massive sphere encrusted with red crystals, they cross a stone bridge to a platform with 3 large statues, of a dragon and 2 other unknown creatures. The silver dragon Fallalanth answers an impertinent comment by Teririst by inviting him into the portrait being drawn. He also offers some suggestions of the factions within the city who might be able to assist them with a Leyden crystal; kobold inventors, dwarves, gnomes or duergar. The party march straight up a steep ramp to face a blue dragon, who agrees to sell them a Leyden crystal for 10k, and construct more if they can provide some large enough Moissanite crystals. He charges up the Leyden crystal with his lightning in front of them, carelessly frying his inventor in the process, negating his capacity to complete the deal. 

The party go back and Fallalanth shows Teririst his completed painting. Moving down to the deep gnome, or Svirfneblin geode at 1 o'clock level 2, were they are told sapphires will make the best Leyden crystals and offered mercenary work. They survive repelling some gem-hungry Xorn with pure brute force and find their stomach contents better than their guard salaries. The party rest to recover ...

Date X+53

The party regroup and head to the grand bazaar in the central geode called the Nexus, full of many different metal, stone and gem based vendors. Thoric flatters a shimmering multi-coloured gem dragon named Kelph and is offered  advice on Leyden crystals and a discount on agency trading. The party peruse various wares particularly adamantium weapons and bulk metal in a dwarves store. Teririst is stalked and nearly ambushed by a cloaker, which he pickpockets a Gem of Brightness from while choking and blinded as the party beat the thing wrapped around him, bruising him too in the process. The smith gives him an adamant dagger for their trouble, and the party debates ownership of the gem, trust and the large shared costs of repairs to the airship.

They collect their goods from the Dwarven geode on the same level at 9oclock, and Senge Firestone offers Thoric 4 days forgework in exchange for right to drop minigates on choice orebodies in their mines below. In the meantime Leon tries his hand as trade negotiator, Teririst at gambling and Thorion as scribe/translator with a stall in the bazaar.

The mines beckon ... Safe? No. Not at all. Full of riches? Yes, that's why we go down there laddies.

Session 14

The party progress through the overrun mine known as the Dismal Delve, enlisting a mercenary young silver dragon named Aram. They narrowly avoid ambush by a number of different mind subverting monsters; a mind flayer with a Kua-Toa swarm, a Spirit Naga and two Minotaurs, and what they may later find out is an Elder Oblex, which ate the memories along with the rest of Virtu’s familiar pseudodragon DeeSix. Aram notes the Naga will resurrect itself in a few days so Thoric constructs a makeshift prison for it. Aram also hints the lower level may be the first level of the Sevenfold Mazework. The party stop to take stock in front of a portal showing a previous dungeon room and some arcane instructions, but are hesitant to actually rest …

Date X+54

The party rest back at the City of Gems, and return to the Dismal Delve, meeting a Guardian Naga and a quiet mage leaving the Delve carrying a sack. They turn out to be friendly, and their names are Acapul Coranes and Semo Pharo. Acapul helpfully suggests banishing his evil relative in the oubliette, which Virtu does, luckily with no resistance. The returning pair also share a partial map copy of the Sevenfold Mazework. The party explore the Delve further, avoiding traps, locks and excavating their way into a secret room to take out another Elder Oblex without a scratch (well, 1 self-inflicted burn), leaving a knife and a statue of Leon behind them. They cleverly bypass a chasm using the portal and enter the Sevenfold Mazework, with no plan on how to return …


Session 15

Our heroes venture into the legendary Sevenfold Mazework, the dim secret heart of the Plane of Earth. Ledges and bridges over chasms are overlooked by animated suits of armour. One is tricked onto a false bridge, and the others dealt with by the party with a mix of flying, leaping and misty steps. 

A red stone lined room guarded by an Iron Cobra contains a well filled with black stones, some of which prove useful on a revisit suggested by Kira as keystones, and some are found to be Ioun stones.

The party clamber over a moving giant spiked gear mechanism between two pits, avoid violet fungus and find interesting items on pillars, including a giant gold tooth even the dragon Aram can’t pick up and the Tome of the Stilled Tongue, which Teririst finds fascinating and is seen poring through and scribbling in furiously. The party find traps, some without triggering, and secret doors near some chattering gargoyles hiding 3 banishment scrolls. 

Teririst unlocks a door from dragonback to find an altar with a large wolf statue with red ruby eyes. Trying to pry these out wakes an Eidolon within the sacred statue, which scares off Aram and another party member likely to deny it. Thoric distracts a patrolling clay golem away from Aram in full flight with a water elemental potion, while the rest of the party are at first unaware of the battle in the statue room. The statue deals massive damage to mirror images of Teririst and actual damage to Kira as the party regroup to finish off both enemies, while Leon finds a way of crossing deep cracks with less risk of instant death to heal foe and harm enemy. 

The party have found a suitable gem for a Leyden crystal, magic items and gold, but are shell shocked, bloodied, out of spells, and hesitant to rest …

Session 16

The party are joined by a Goldspire apprentice sorcerer named Ellis, who offers to stand guard with Thoric and the Watermelonental in the hard to access statue room. Thoric notices Teririst scribbling and tearing pages from the Tome of the Stilled Tongue then suddenly go invisible. When asked Teririst says he wants to investigate the gold tooth, so Thoric suggests Leon go too then thinks about ways to melt it down and post it back through portals. Leon slips jumping the chasm and just catches a chain, to be rescued by the flying invisible Tabaxi and taken to a landing near an unexplored room in the middle of the chasm. Teririst bids Leon wait while he sneaks into a sleeping mages library. Flashes and noises are heard by Leon and Teririst returns as the rest of the party wake up and make their way over on Aram to fight an evil archmage and his apprentice. The water elemental is matched by an air element in a whirling duel, but the party overcome and choose to subdue the mages rather than kill them. No mercy is shown to their loot of magic books and dusts however, and Teririst lets Thoric hold Vecna’s tome (which the archmage is clearly terrified of) from then on, despite whatever he may have agreed too and the risks to his raspy tongue. 

The heroes move on, to find a charnel room of skinned corpses and ghostly alien technology launch a slightly more successful sneak attack on a Starspawn Larva Mage and it’s wormy and insanity inducing minions, taking their most damage to date yet still squashing the vermin while dodging spike drop traps and gaining an Immovable Rod for their victory .

The group are still out of spells and in need of rest, yet definitely not comfortable to.

Session 17

Goldspire open a gate, which Teririst and the Tome of the Stilled Tongue are sent through, with some of the more dubious artefacts for further study.

The party make their way past traps and over chasms to clear the rest of the 1st fold of the Sevenfold Mazework. DeeSix assists in propping up a trapped bridge with the immovable rod, and Kira looks through the walls ahead to see an Ettercap in its webs. The party burst through the door to surprise it, finding 2 more in there as well, dispatching them without issue. Ellis opens a blinking eye chest to gain the ability to cast True Polymorph for a fortnight at the cost of her health. The webs conceal hidden empty prison cells with dimensional shackles, and an Ebony Fly figurine which Leon uses to fly over precipices and traps safely, and the party shuttle around with when not pressing the increasingly grumpy dragon Aram.

Jeff, Leon and Aram investigate some Dwarven inscriptions while Virtu and DeeSix jump and fly to another island room to disturb an Ankheg. The paladins gracefully leap over gaps and squeeze through fissures to run to the rescue, while Ellis misses a leap to clutch onto a chain and be rescued by the giant fly. A Leyden sized emerald, boots of elvenkind and an Anstruth harp are found on a partly dissolved dark elf, after Kira and Virtu finish off the Ankheg, getting sprayed with acid for their efforts.

Most of the party avoid one trap and cut through a door while Virtu goes a different way and is nearly petrified before Thoric dispels the trap. Barrels of full of thousands of strange bronze coins are found with another iron barrel and a secret library full of magic metal tomes promising the secrets of increasing abilities when studied and practiced. The iron barrel is sitting right on a lightning trap, but this doesn’t stop Jeff from opening it up, and experimenting with some controls he finds inside, which wave legs and periscopes around precariously close to the blue lightning rune on the ground around it.

Another room holds an altar surrounded by offerings with a secret room with a wooden chest Thoric sets on fire while heating the metal lock. The scrolls inside are browned and cracked, but mended to reveal official Dao documents of some kind written in Terran.

The final unexplored room is charged open by Leon on flyback with a lance to reveal a locked emerald chest, which looks to contain a Leyden size red crystal. Leon takes the whole chest rather than attempt opening it.

The party, relieved at gaining their main objective in the 3 crystals, consider how to transport the large gold tooth, and whether to go deeper or how to leave.

Session 18

As a gate from Goldspire closes after Teririst rejoin the party a hermit Gith runs up saying “Goldspire"! He turns out to be Farlian, a ranger sent out by the mages long ago whose whole party was missing presumed dead. Ellis confirms the risks may not have been made clear to prospective min-gate droppers.

The party figure out how to operate the Apparatus of Kwalish, but not how to get it across the chasms of the Sevenfold Mazework. They leave it and move to the large gold tooth. Thoric melts it to reforge into 17 large gold bars. Aram assists with carrying it all back to the start of the Delve, where he asks for his share, taking the strange bronze coins, and parts ways with our heroes on good terms.


Returning to the City of Gems the party negotiate the construction of the 3 Leyden crystals with Tren Coldlight of the Svirfneblin and spend the two weeks they take retrieving the Apparatus of Kwalish with a hired mage then studying the tomes they’ve found. 

Date X+68

They also find incidentally that all gems on the plane are magically marked as property of the Dao and find a way to offload the ones they’ve found with some steep bribes.

The party find the two earth elementals, Grog & Bog who dug them a tunnel into the city, with the aid of some suspect letters of passage, and convince them to dig a return tunnel.

Along the way a Remorhaz ambushes them, and despite burning everything close to it is worn down quickly by the party and despatched by Farlian.

The party emerge from the side of Mt Fundus to see the airship again and bid farewell to Grog & Bog.

Session 19

The party notice the airship is keeping a large distance from the ground, Virtu magically calls out to the ship, who wave back and point to a squad of ogres who hear the shout too and start charging toward the party from a long way away. Thoric recalls the elementals Grog & Bog to dig a trench/rampart quickly and the party await the charge. The airship takes a long-range bolt from one of the ogres wielding ballista as crossbows and moves out of range for the duration. Thoric, Ellis and Teririst break up the squad with walls of fire and a cloud of fog. Leon mounts the giant fly and charges two of the ogres in a row skewering them both. Teririst lays in from the flanks and leaps through the flames unscathed while Virtu grapples and roasts an Ogre Howdah in the flame wall using the Apparatus of Kwalish, incinerating the goblins riding the mini fort on the ogres back. An ogre knocks down Thoric and Ellis with a chain to be taken down by Thoric. 

The party install the Leyden crystals, and Thoric mounts the ballista on the airship Aspalex, and rig a derrick for loading and unloading the AoK. Another ballista in the Dismal Delve is recalled, but retrieving it is thought impractical for now.

Teririst devises a way of bottling lightning, but not clouds which Leon claims convincingly he knows, and Thoric tries again to reckon fair shares of the loot so far but is unsure of fair values, and also finds some neglected items in the hold, including a weapon cache and the Dread Star morning star.

The party come to a temporary detente with the gith on the post-salvage ownership of Aspalex, provided their goals stay aligned, and then all agree to finish dropping mini gates in the Plane of Fire  before returning to Corus Vale, helped by Virtu convincing our budding aeronauts the City of Brass is a good destination for trade of rare items.

Date X+69

Session 20

Aspalex the airship cruises in a self-satisfied way with all aboard toward a bright orange glow in the distance. They make steady progress over the barren hills of the Plane of Earth, with some repairs and a only herd of Gorgon below to pass the time. The light turns out to come from the top of a large volcano, which has a town and a monastery on its slopes. 

Date X+71

Stopping at the town they are greeted nervously by assorted races, mostly Jann and a human knight called Evin Giltall who offers a reward for the return of his uncle, the famous smith Theldin Giltall, kidnapped by the fire giant Brimskarda. A select squad starts up the mountain with the flammable ship left safely with the crew to assist with repairs to the town.

The heroes are met at the monastery by the leader of the “giant wrestlers" Diasma, who informs them of the schemes of Brimskarda the fire giant leader, who’s taken the Star Forge with her clan from the red dragon Akaanvaerd to recover her status in the Ordning of the giants. Diasma describes the forge as being on an island in a crater lake, which has recently become much much more acidic due to uncontrolled leakage from the fallen star the forge was built on.

She challenges the heroes to the monastery’s 3 Fireside contest tests to earn further help. The heroes beat the monastery’s champion at a cliff rope climb, a boulder haul over a lava field and a last man standing challenge under a waterfall. Diasma offers them 3 magic items and assistance from her and 3 fellow giant wrestlers.

The party crest the volcano to see 4 fire giants harrying Akaanvaerd, and the giant wrestlers move in to distract them while the heroes descend into the crater. A building on the lake edge turns out to be a small forge operated by two Cinder Hulks feeding scrap metal in to make ingots. Virtu hails them to be attacked on sight, and the party defeat them only to find they explode into a cloud of cinders, which ignites some grease dropped by Ellis just as the party slide out of the flammable slick.

A pair of acid-resistant rings and a large tablet with a fire rune are found in the pile of scrap metal. The rings are fire giant sized, making usable bangles.

The party approach a ruined bridge, to be immediately attacked by some Acidic Mist Apparitions, which fling several of the party around including Leon and his fly into to the stinging turquoise water. Thoric parts the waters (holding a tablet?), all the way across to the island leaving Leon undissolved, but flat in the mud. The heroes regroup with Ellis finishing the last apparition, and we leave the party looking at their temporary channel to the island, knowing there was a fire giant and a pair of salamanders in the islands middle, backed by the ringing hammers and blazing light from the Star Forge behind it.

Session 21

Meanwhile back aboard Aspalex Argh sees the dragon attacking something on the summit and convinces the gith Aplex to planeshift him, Teririst & Salmur to the party, letting Virtu & Ellis tap out. They see the dragon Akaanvaerd Enervate a fire giant while one of the Wrestlers is crushed by a boulder, and another giant runs screaming down into the crater in fear. Akaanvaerrd picks up another fire giant, taking multiple giant greatsword hits for his efforts and drops him in the acid lake. The giant emerges screaming and melting to collapse on the island side of the lake edge near the Starforge.

Our heroes cross between Thorics water walls as quickly as they can and see a large fire giant cleric with a pair of salamanders walking away from them to inspect their dead clansman. From the safety of a rocky hill Thoric summons wave after acidic wave to pummel the cleric and her elemental summons across the beach, while the others rush up to the waves edge only to stop short and practice taunts ignored by the giant with bigger wave sized problems. The Fire Giant of Evil Fire cleric does send a few bolts of Imix at the party before exploding in the scalding waves and admits in response to Leons taunt "serves me right for throwing all those kobolds in the lake’.

Argh claims her Searing Scepter as a Goliath sized polearm and the party move closer to the blinding and scorching Starforge, seeing 4 glowing white pillars before it with Giantish runes and veins of glowing magma. One pillar is glowing much brighter than the others, with a cracked rune. Thoric mends the rune and the acrid vapours steaming off the lake diminish.

Within the forge chamber the ringing of two hammers loud and small continues unabated. A half-built colossus sits in the corner. Teririst has his whiskers singed off peeking around the door to see Brimskarda standing and  Theldin on the 10’ anvil with a 100’ adamantine chain locked around his ankle. Both wear goggles protecting them from the incredible heat.

Thoric itches to test his fire immunity gift from Moradin as the party confer and nearly send in Argh, only to heatproof the invisible Teririst and send him in to pick the lock on Theldins chain. He is burned and blinded, and still manages to free Theldin, holding up the loose chain and telling him to run for it. Teririst and Theldin clamber off the anvil and bolt together, holding the chain. Brimskarda roars at the smith to come back and yanks the chain, only to have it come back empty. She runs after the smith, to be ambushed outside the forge and beaten without a single reply attack. Theldin is astonished, and begs them to destroy  Brimskarda’s war project, a Runic Colossus before it can be used by anyone else.

The heroes oblige knowing the circling dragon will likely return to the lair.

Returning through Thoric parted waters again, they see another fire giant tumbling down the scree to be picked up and dropped in the lake by Akaanvaerd, again taking sword and boulder hits in the process. This giant survives the now less acidic water to try for the crater wall again only for Thoric to hit it with waves of acid. Teririst climbs the rough slope to advise the Wrestlers the smith has been rescued and the monks disengage.

Akaanvaerd notices Brimskarda’s oversized corpse and flys back to roar his victory claim on the Starforge, and the remaining 2 fire giants look despondently over the lake with no way to take revenge, moving slowly out of sight. The heroes start moving off along the far lakeside, only to be noticed by the dragon, who flys over toward them. The party are unsure if he will attack and spread out, but he lands and asks dubiously if they dealt with Brimskarda. The party claim they did and try to convince the dragon they could do the same to it. They haggle over access to the forge and smithing of items, until the fire giants lob surprise boulders at him forcing a quick alliance. The dragon grasps Argh & Teririst in its claws sweeping up the crater wall.

Argh knocks one off the edge and it rolls to the bottom for rest of the climbing party to finish off while Akaanvaerd finishes the other with claws and teeth. He returns to the party, noting that he only needs one smith (the fleeing Theldin) and thanks the party for clumping together nicely before blasting them with flames. The party survive this and return the attack, knocking the dragon to a thread of its life before it wing blasts them and launches off, only for Teririst to snipe it down from cover.

The heroes can’t believe what they’ve achieved and Thoric spelunks into a cavern below the forge to find the dragons mostly molten hoard next to a lava pool and the meteorite powering the Starforge, including another Tome of the Stilled Tongue. A kobold smith appears from hiding, disarms a few traps and offers to help keep working the forge, which Theldin grudgingly accepts.

Contacting Goldspire again Mayber von Tollant is insistent that they hand this over too despite Thorics suggestion of dropping it in the lava pool.

The town and the monks thank them in kind with Grappler training, smithing work, and barding Aspalex in red dragon scales and wing sails in preparation for their next destination in the Plane of Fire. Thoric raises the fallen monk who then victoriously attends his own wake. 

The liberators of the Starforge from the Forgecaller and the Red Wyrm may be known throughout history, if only the tale is spread, especially if the forge is held.

Session 22

While the party finish training, Thoric “Hammer of Moradin" calls in dwarven support to colonise Starforge, and Leon runs an inaugural council between the village of Redstone, the Fireside Monastery and the new Dwarves of Starforge, who agree to work together, helped by the party sharing Akaanvaerd’s loot congealed into bar form. Thoric and Leon have spiked shields made to the giants design with Darksteel from under the forge, while Teririst unearths the Helm of Halva from the airships hold, disguises himself as Leon and terrifies Leon while wearing it. Leon lashes out and wrestles the helm off him.

Once their work and training is complete the party head off for the City of Brass, making their way into the Plane of Fire in their newly red-scaled airship. They outfly a large swarm of magma mephits, picking off a few, but cannot do the same the next day for a young red dragon. It names itself Ephlon and seems quite confused by the red scales on the airship until Virtu and Thoric name the scale donor, which enrages the dragon into a suicidal charge. Leon and Thoric taunt it about what they did to its father and the party wallop, smite, blind and incapacite it before Teririst despatches it in the same way.

Date X+85


Session 23

Aspalex and all aboard move further into the Plane of Fire, following a converging pattern of deep cracks in the ground (the Fissures) toward a yawning pit in the middle of the Cinder Wastes. A squadron of Abishai sneak up under Aspalex and attempt to charm them. Virtu yells out in Infernal and invites the devils to board. The red abishai leader names himself Kilf and asks if they’ve seen any demons. Thoric truthfully denies this and mentions the parties' recent exploits but quickly prevaricates to avoid sending the Abishai to Redstone when they show interest in a slip of the tongue. Kilf knew Akaanvaerd was ejected from Starforge and is unimpressed at claims of his defeat but admire the new use of his scales. He charms Salmur and nearly claims him before Leon steps in. Kilf grumbles he doesn’t have wings anyway and requests the party kill any demons they see before leading his squadron off in tight formation.

The ship flies on through cinder storms into sight of a huge pit with swarms of creatures crawling out of it. A mob of Vrock flyers attack the ship to be taken out with only a mild stun to show for it. The party try to press on but are forced back by a firestorm rather than fly over the Vent. After the storm passes the party continue on course, and Aspalex is teleported onto by a Balor. The party brave its fiery aura to attack it from all sides and it does not get a hit in before it cries out telepathically ‘What are you creatures?’ and explodes in a blaze of fire, damaging the ship and everyone, outright killing Leon, Ellis and Farlian with it. Fortunately, Thoric and Virtu survive to Raise and Revivify them, and mend Aspalex.

Date X+88

The party fly on towards the City of Brass, over shambling mounds and low hills. Thoric creates a heroes feast each night, sharing among the crew and the two nightmares as well as trying to lure in another two which have been following along at a distance. Persistence pays off over a few days.

Date X+91

They notice a ruined fort to the east and intervene between some hell hounds and salamanders, putting down the hounds quickly. The salamanders give them their flaming spears in respect but can’t help with any knowledge of the ruins. The heroes move toward the fort as another cinder storm approaches.

Landing they notice small lizards and crystal veins and outcrops which Thoric considers magic extraction methods on. Aargh, and then others see evidence of boulders moving in random directions, out of the corners of their eyes. Investigation shows nothing obvious about the rocks, although an abandoned mine nearby has been clouded with an illusion.

The party set off for the fort on nightmare-back, before noticing Salmur climb off the boat and head for the mine in a daze. Asking him what’s going on gives confused replies until it seem he relays a message saying the party is welcome without the horses.

Entering the mine, there are many shafts and drives in different directions, some hidden by illusions but Salmur forges ahead confidently to a large, deep shaft with many openings into it. On a ledge across from them sit Feldspar, an emerald dragon, who tells them he and a sapphire dragon need help to close the Vent, the portal to the Abyss the party saw earlier.

Feldspar suggests they start with the City of Brass as humanoids, and a meeting place after at the Sable Forest.

Thoric engages in trade negotiations and gifts Feldspar an emerald xylophone and statuette of Feldspar, with floating spines Feldspar telekinetically animates himself delightedly, returning a feather anchor token for the airship.

Date X+92

Session 24

The Nightmares prove to be carnivorous, aggressive and prone to biting. Teririst names his Smoky Joe, Virtu's is Bucephalus, Leons is White Socks and Thoric's Red Lightning.

The party shelter the airship from the storm behind the ruined fort walls and continue on to the City of Brass. On the approach, they see a gargantuan spiked monster approaching the city. Gates are being closed on queues of merchant caravans and the brass walls shudder and the earth cracks near it as the city rises slowly out of the ground on its enormous brass bowl.

Teririst identifies it as a Tarrasque, one of the largest and most fearsome creatures there is. 

The party engage it on nightmare-back while Aargh charges it on foot. A targeted spell bounces off its reflective carapace into the sky, and others it seems to choose to ignore, charging for the caravans until it notices the pesky adventurers, and swallows Aargh. Teririst launches off Smoky Joe, hides on the monsters vast back and stabs repeatedly, and Virtu takes a blow instead of his nightmare Bucephalus to be knocked out of the air to the ground for his trouble. Bucephalus surprises Virtu and Aargh by whisking them all from near death to the Ethereal plane, followed by Leon on White Socks.

Thoric is the next to stand and face down the Tarrasque and is knocked out cold and nearly snapped up in teeth like bone short swords. The ethereal plane is a misty thick fog of what they see in the Plane of Fire, allowing escape from the Tarrasque’s stomach for Aargh, but he chooses not to, returning after being healed to the creatures gut, stabbing from the inside until it vomits him out, releasing Thoric from its mouth in the process.

The Tarrasque grabs Aargh in its teeth again and decides to escape the painful nuisances into the Sea of Fire with him as a consolation snack. The party finish the fleeing Tarrasque as it splashes into the lava, taking Aargh down with it. The party rush to rescue him, on ethereal Nightmares and Thoric shaping a tunnel into the molten stone as it slowly sinks.

The merchants look on amazed at the scene as do efreeti soldiers on the walls of the floating city behind them.

The party use the feather anchor to stop the carcass from sliding into the lava, and Leon enlists the help of the merchants to haul it out, promising them portions of the beast. The merchants fall over themselves to help after some hesitation and set to work on butchering it, one noticing some missing weapons in the process, glaring at his colleagues while Virtu attempts to convince Teririst to return them. Some contacts are made and a promise to have some teeth and carapace available for pickup from the market in a few days. 

The city lowers back to the ground, and the gates open to reveal a squad of the Eternal Crimson guards, who waive the gate fee and send them to the docks and pass on a request to attend the Sultan at the Charcoal Palace. At the docks they are met by an official who is very helpful after Virtu suspects he paid too much for docking.

The party leave anything unnecessary on the boat and ventures into the city along the Street of Stelae, toward the Pyraculum bazaar and the palace.

A blind and disheveled human grabs Aargh’s hand and tells him some things about the past and future it’s unlikely he’d be able to know. Leon is told he’ll help a devil into the heavens, and the others to be careful with their choices as there are many possible outcomes from meeting the Sultans court. 

The party venture in to the bazaar looking for lodgings and a bathhouse, attracting attention, bewildered by choice and hordes of shoppers of all races and unable to read any Ignan signs. Teririst spots a shingle displaying a blue bell, which the party are relieved to find is a tavern. They are told bathhouses are rare as water is very expensive, and the four nightmares mark them as nobility immediately treated to the best rooms, an exotic feast, a large tab, and Leon the attention of an Efreeta noble. Aargh an Virtu are taken out back by the ears to be dust bathed and given new white robes with gold trim and Aargh left barechested with a purple sash.

The efreeta noble Dalia fawns over Leon’s stories of the Tarrasque and the ship, shares her own of the annual Sultans Steeplechase in 4 days, and on hearing of their audience with the Sultan helps them to buy attire in the current fashions. The heroes attend the Charcoal Palace and join the queue of petitioners in the Red Pillar Halls. Dalia introduces her husband, the court physician, who heals them as they wait and observe the courtiers vying for attention and influence, and the immediate silence every time the Sultan speaks. 

The Sultan congratulates them on defeating the Tarrasque and saving the city a repair bill then announces their names granting the "Crew of the Airship Aspalex" a key to the city, to the annoyance of his general. The party advise the Sultan of the demon portal, and he immediately dispatches scouts and a shock force to investigate and contain the threat, and accepts their offer of help, asking them to return the next day.

Dalia and her husband offer lodging at their house, the Palazzo of the Blue Horse and the party gratefully accept Dalia sends for their belongings plus tab from the Blue Bell and is told someone was asking after them. An "ordinary" feast is laid out for them with no salt, and the party are given servants quarters for all except Leon who’s invited to Dalia’s room, and is unsure how to deal with her without offending. 

A new dawn gleams off the spires and towers of the City of Brass …

Date X+93

Session 25

An epic mural of the party battling the Tarrasque is seen painted inside the city wall near the gate of the Eternal Sun in the City of Brass weeks later.

The party discuss horse racing with Miraz before answering their return summons to the Sultan who also has an interest and makes a bet with Teririst. They attend the war room with General Abd Multahib, share information plan and gather allies. All agree they will need 100 casters to cast Gate Seal as a ritual over a full day with an iron chain over the portal.  Four nightmare riders will be sent ahead with the Angels of Death and other cavalry units, to make camp and clear the perimeter while the ship and infantry follow behind. 

The party stop at the Palazzo of the Blue Horse to get their things and Dahlia, who is one of the few sorcerers who can cast Gate Seal. They stop briefly at the bazaar to buy magic items, with Dahlia’s guidance and use the most of the opportunity and their money. Teririst is impressed by a Luck Blade and earns the close attention of the proprietor and his iron golem guard.

As they leave they are approached by a devil naming himself Lt. Farew asking Thoric and Leon to meet with his master Gargepore in a nearby palazzo. The party stand considering the offer and the specifics and value of Lt. Farews word, knowing they have to leave on their mission to close the Vent in an hour.

Teririst more than idly dreams of stealing the Luck Blade.

The party let Lt Farew lead them to a nearby run down palazzo guarded by Merregon and introduces them to his hell knight master Gargepore. The devil asks the paladin and cleric with holy symbols of good deities for assistance in getting to the celestial planes as a matter of no choice for him, wondering how many demons he would need to kill and if he'd get credit for past efforts.

Thoric and Leon offer what little they know and suggest they will offer character references if the devils assist in closing the Vent. Gargepore agrees and offers them a glass of steaming blood or whatever their chosen beverage is to seal this deal.

Gargepore agrees to meet them outside the Gate of the Eternal Sun, and has his and Farew's nightmares saddled in minutes.

The crew return to Aspalex to have it ready to follow with the infantry and support troops.

Joining the Angels of Death nightmare archer battalion they are assigned to the Fireball 5 squadron with Captain biz Alizard. A smaller battalion of nightmare lancers also forms up sloppily holding various banners of noble houses of the City of Brass.

Their new devil allies and Dahlia ride with them into the Cinder Wastes, uneventfully at first as most natives scatter on sight of the flying horde.

A red dragon is seen matching their speed and course off high to the west. Thoric gathers the party to the captains annoyance and sends to the dragon suggesting a mutual benefit. The ancient red dragon Felparazin offers safe approach and sees an interest in closing the demon portal, guaranteeing he won't eat anyone in the army until the portal is closed. He does ask if they'd considered that no portal can be opened without the approval of the ruler of the plane.

Riding on through cinderstorms the party make camp without noticing they were on an ancient cairn, being ambushed at night by wraiths, spectres and shadows, who drain Ellis, Teririst, Virtu and two efreet before they are sent to eternal rest.

  
One tent is torn through by a nightmare chasing a wraith, and one wraith was turned by Thoric to be hopefully finished by the army. Flying on through cinderstorms only minor skirmishes occur. Thoric offers hero's feasts to various allies and makes the dragon a silver claw ring, as the party admit to previous encounters with red dragons, tempering his attitude to the party while not breaking the agreement. Leon comments to Felparizin: "You're the second dragon we've dined with in a week". Dahlia is impressed with Leon approaching the dragon.

Arriving at the Vent the army clear off scattered demons and make camp, and they are met by the emerald and sapphire dragons Feldspar and Apstakformin who make a temporary lauth, or dragon alliance, with Felparazin. Supplies are ported in from the City of Brass and a dozen dwarves from Starforge. Plans, camp, and anchor points are made ready for the rest of the army in preparation for sealing the Vent.

3 iron chains will span the mile wide hole, and 30 stations around it will have Gate Seal cast as a ritual for a full day, with the army protecting them.

The chasm yawns into the Abyss, with unknown purpose and defences ...

Date X+96

Session 26

The army plans and prepares for the gate sealing. Standing orders are given:

1. Protect the casters and chain at all costs

2. Don’t fall in

3. Don’t pursue demons

4. No using the cliff as a latrine once battle starts

Marking out and construction of the anchor points begins, and Thoric suggests casting Hallow on one or two anchor points which takes a full day. The general agrees with Thoric and another cleric casting in different locations while the rest of the party patrol or prepare. Virtu and Ellis chase a slowly flying Nalfeshnee into the pit and face it down bravely, until a final act of spite it shoves Virtu off Bucephalus before teleporting away. Ellis drops down on her Nightmare (Red Lightning, borrowed from Thoric) and grasps and misses for Virtu, who then Misty Steps onto the nightmares back behind her.  Red Lightning avoids the fast-approaching abyssal portal using Ethereal Stride.

Cinder storms rage and an exhausted Thoric pushes on to Hallow another anchor point, sleeping odd hours and facing down a swarm of small flying Quasit with 3 efreet guards, sending to Leon who wakes a grumpy Feldspar but is too far away to assist in time. Virtu and Leon fend off goat-like climbing demons the efreeti later call Bulezau, and Teririst trains Smoky Joe in dressage and stealth. Thoric pushes into a 3rd and final Hallow before the infantry arrive.

Leon and Teririst stay to guard Thoric this time, and are ambushed by darkling bat-like demons who drain Teririst and an efreet guard with their gaze. Teririst flys up from underneath and behind and launches onto the Nabassu, grappling and then pinning its wings to fall with it and land it on it like a shock absorber. 2 Nabassu try to flee, but Teririst rides his like a rolling log despite taking massive damage, and the efreeti Angels of Death finish them both off. Leon has blinded one, suppressing its draining gaze and it fights on unaware of its companion's fate to be finished shortly after.

Meanwhile the ground army arrives in a cinderstorm and the party return to camp to hear a furious roar from Felparizin, the ancient red dragon at the sight of Aspalex arriving barded in red dragon scales. Leon and Thoric approach him with Teririst slightly to the side while Virtu hurries to warn Aspalex. Efreeti scatter in fear as Felparizin demands answers, asking if they would like to see him wearing their kith and kin’s skin as a cloak. Leon and Thoric calm Felparizin down slightly, naming Akaanvaerd an oathbreaker, and offer to remove the barding after they leave the Plane of Fire, to which Felparizin agrees.

The dragon says he will keep his word and return in the morning, flying away for the night. The party and army take a final rest before the battle, to the sound of guards fighting demons near the pit …

Date X+96

Session 27

The morning arrives with a snow-like fall of ash. Gargepore and Lt. Farew turn out to have been busy providing intelligence on their demon opponents from long experience in the Blood War. The squads form behind each group of casters, and Thoric casts Forbiddance on the chains before the dragons and efreet lift them high and spread the ends into position like a giant umbrella. Some mount points appear to have been damaged overnight, and teams of horses hold them in place until repaired.

The Gate Seal ritual starts and waves of demons start pouring out and climbing the chimney like Vent. The army easily enough handles swarms of Dretch and Maw Demons, although the gaps between the mount points are not covered and demons swarm out into the Plane of Fire. Quasit fly out and give Aspalex and crew moments of minor concern as the part of the flock goes invisible. Thoric and Virtu take out groups of them at once while Leon rides through on White Socks. Teririst drapes a canvas over the ballista to hide and snipe with it.

The party keep patrolling with the dragons covering other tridrants in a slow rotation. Rutterkin and goat-like Bulezau are dealt with by the army easily enough, but Hezrou driven on by crab-clawed Glabrezu prove a significant challenge, stunning and confuse Leon, Thoric, 2 nightmares and several efreet, which the Hezrou finish off to disintegrate in puffs of smoke. The army deal with most of the Hezrou, while Virtu uses Raulathim’s Psychic Lance to drop several onto the Glabrezu below them knocking at least one off too. Thoric and Leon are also grappled by the Glabrezu casting Fly. Others flying prove good targets for Dispel, but the ones who make the cliff top can also cast this and try without luck for the Hallow protecting the ritual casters, and with luck on sections of the chain, before being taken out. Thoric kills a Glabrezu grappling him while being grappled by another and both are pulled down off Red Lightning by the dead weight, towards the yawning abyssal portal below.

Thoric uses his Cape of the Mountebank to escape the fall, back to Red Lightning, and the last Glabrezu gives up and falls back through the portal to escape seeing his last ally die.

The party take stock after 6 hours into the day long ritual, wondering how to last through another 18 hours of this

Session 28

Thoric and Virtu take long and short rests respectively and Farlian and Aesir take a shift, with shade of the ash rain counting in the favour of the drow. Another wave of demons arrive, squads of Frost Giant demons with their souls visibly burning in their chests called Fury of Kostchchies clamber up the cliff at speed. Leon and Aesir charge in on Nightmare back after Aesir gets bitten mounting Bucephalus. The giant demons launch a volley of rocks at them, dealing massive damage in multiple hits. Leon goes out to snipe from long range while Aesir and Bucephalus stride into the Ethereal plane to choose their moment. Teririst and Farlian operate the ballistae, with the bow having a new hide recently fabricated around it from Polar Worm chitin. 

The Furies slow slightly to launch rocks at the efreet army as they climb who start taking casualties. The army start firing back at once the Furies get close enough, focusing on one at a time. Aesir emerges behind a Fury to attack with a glaive from just far enough away to avoid the giants long arms and aura of frost then dash away. Luckily only the one Fury throws a rock at Aesir, but this is still enough to knock him out. Bucephalus returns him to the skiff for a healing rest.

The Furies crest the cliff to close with the army and short-lived carnage to both sides ensues.

Leon is healed to continue, and Aspalex returns to patrol. More demons appear both climbing and flying, and the crew decide to let the army take the climbers while they take a flock of Incubi and Succubi. These attempt to charm the crew but only manage affect Salmur. Next, they shapeshift into Leon and Thorics form but to little avail as the two paladins use their Divine Sense to see through the ruse. Salmur is drained by a kiss, then knocks the demon out of the air with a thunderous smite. The remaining demons go ethereal, but Farlian can see them still, dropping into the ships hold. The party chase them into and out of the ethereal plane to finish them.

A jewelled crown and two jade & gold demon-chess boards are the spoils. 

The ash rain gives way to a cinder storm and 16 hours remain to close off the portal to the Abyss …

Session 29

Aspalex and crew keep patrolling through the cinder storm. Lacking visibility, they decide to keep with the plan of a circular path and trust the army are doing their part on the cliff tops. Crossing the chain, they meet a squad of Angels of Death drafted as backup to patrol along those lines, bringing news of Shoosuva attacks on the cliffs. On deck, a portal opens from Goldspire revealing a particularly brave war-forged sorcerer named Sycamore volunteering to keep the peace, against her abhorrence of war, and slight flammability in a hostile environment. 

A score of Vrock flap their way up out of the Vent, and the party set to battle with partially effective ranged attacks as the Vrock ascend.

Ellis casts Confusion twice, causing chaos and infighting which continues longer than the spells. The party stay on Aspalex knowing from a previous encounter the Vrock can stun with a screech. Aargh rides the wing sail to meet the Vrock and soaks up the first wave attacks while the rest of the party stay in the aura of the paladins to avoid being stunned or poisoned. Sycamore and Ellis find lines of attack for lightning bolts while Teririst and Leon deal massive damage from clouds of smoke and thunderous smites, with Farlian sniping away with a fey summon assisting.

The Vrock eventually fall after a long battle and the party take a short rest without interruption. Continuing through the storm they make out Felparizin the ancient red dragon badly wounded and holding off three Balor with only his frightening presence. Aspalex approaches and the crew man the bows and catapults, while Leon mounts White Socks with Aargh behind him wishing he could have brought Elk and flinging daggers which fall short and into the abyssal portal. 

Felparizin finishes off a Balor with teeth and claws, which explodes in a fiery ball the dragon ignores like a cool breeze. The other Balor whip his front leg aside and carve a sword right through the dragon’s chest.

Flashes of fiery light beat out of the dragon's chest. Leon and Aargh charge in on nightmare-back and lay into the Balor, with Farlian providing supporting fire. The Balor are not to be distracted from their gargantuan victim so close to victory though. 

  
Felparizin lunges with a free claw and grabs a Balor like a toy, then begins to squeeze and mouth a chant in draconian. The Balor begins shrink in an oddly distorted way, turning into a ball of pulsing sickly energy and demonic flesh. Felparizin grasps his own torn rib cage and opens it with the other claw with all nearby staring, shocked into a fascinated trance. He shoves the demonic energy ball into his own heart, and is suddenly infused with the dark fiery energy, healing and growing even larger than before. Felparizin was the biggest dragon all present had ever seen, but now he had found a way to ascend and grow even further into chromatic greatwym, surging with streams of fire.

Almost casually he reaches out and grabs the other slack-jawed Balor and turns to the party, thanking them for being there. Felparizin muses that he has thought of another way to resolve their recent dispute, and keep the dragon scale on Aspalex by re-storing the life-force of the dragon Akaanvaerd in Aspalex with a Balor heart-engine. The party demur to Aspalex as creature able to make its own decision. Aspalex stammers in trepidation then announces: ‘Make me a dragon!’. Felparizin summons the bony skull of Akaanvaerd from a Starforge wall mount and fixes it to the bowsprit. He looks at the empty eye sockets and tuts in disapproval, then summons two rough diamonds to fill the holes. 

Felparizin then grabs a section of Aspalex’s planking and scale, tearing it back and open like a page in a book, to expose Aspalex’s inner workings with the Leyden crystals crackling with blue potential. He squeezes down the Balor like a large blood-orange and rams the demon/heart home into Aspalex’s hold.

Aspalex shudders. The red skin sails morph into wings, the rigging and chains are shrugged off, and the scales smooth and tighten back, fusing into the wood, looking more like skin over supple muscle instead of inanimate wood. Akaanvaerd’s bony head shakes and looks around

Meanwhile the battle rages around the Vent, and elsewhere plots good and evil are formed and acted on.

Thoric stirs in his hammock below, dreaming of books full of secret markings, with the tongues of indiscreet readers pinned to their covers.

Session 30

Our heroes take stock of the new situation. Felparazin brings forth fresh scales over Akaanvaerd's skull/bowsprit and talks to him to confirm his oath breaking, and for this binds him to the party's service for 10 years. 

Two squadrons of Abishai fly in, some in a pincer move from behind. While they offer to help against the demons, they still try their luck charming Felparazin and Akaanvaerd, fortunately to no avail. They take patrol duties for higher above the chains and lower down the Vent near the portal.

Patrols resume and soon enough what appear to be Efreet rise out of the Vent. Virtu booms out a challenge from a distance but the replies are faint. Leon, Teririst and Virtu mount nightmares and ride out to investigate. Foul play ensues as Teririst is sent fleeing. Leon casts Spirit Guardians thoughtfully stored in a ring by Thoric earlier, and swoops and dodges around what prove to be Cambion which throw everything they have at Leon, while Farlian supports by sniping with the ballista.

Virtu is charmed into attacking the chain, fortunately with little effect, although Teririst and Salmur on the rear ballista don't trust this and try to break the charm with force.

Teririst force feeds Virtu a sleeping potion leaving him slung like a sloth on the chain before throwing him into the side of Bucephalus after he wakes up.

Leon continues ducking and weaving around the Cambion who can only barely scratch him, shredding them until one by one they plane shift to escape or die in a puff of smoke leaving their gear to fall into the Abyss.

Returning to Aspalex/Akaanvaerd the demon-hearted dragon/boat, the patrol continues.

Floating up through the cinder storm come a spattering of Dybbuk, spread out wide. The ballista starts picking them off, and then the archers too as they get higher. The last few manage to reach Aspalex and pass right through the hull, into the hold and surprise Thoric just starting to stir in his hammock.

He tries to turn undead, but the demons only look like corpses. The crew rush to the hatches and down the ladders to finish them off, leaving a horrid stench.

The storm abates and the smoke cloud lifts, showing the chain mostly intact across the Vent, and the army holding all positions at around 3/4 strength changing guard and reinforcing for the final stretch. 

More concerning are the swarms of assorted demons wandering aimlessly around the plain, and much further out from 3 different directions the dust plume of unknown armies marching toward the Vent. Thoric uses the Sending stones to check in with General biz Alizard, who confirms this sighting is not expected and is sending scouts to reconnoitre.

Virtu, in a stroke of frustrated genius or maybe insanity considers communicating with the demon's leader but lacks any way to actually know who this is to do this.

The patrol continues, Aspalex/Akaanvaerd kiting away to snipe at a safe distance at Maurezhi climbing up the cliff, (more undead like demons) and then similar for Echoes of Demogorgon, which are Ettin made even more monstrosity like. The Maurezhi are finished easily where they aren't left to roam the plain, but the Echoes reach the army and cause chaos before falling. 

The thunderous booms, sub-sonic roars and crackling waves of flame rising a quarter of the cliff height all issuing from Felparazin as he rains destruction on demons echo back and forth across the Vent in a way none there will forget for the rest of their lives. Many present fear rightly that may not even be til the dawn ...

Session 31

A pack of hog-like demons with short wings, or Nalfeshnee, swarm toward the ship. The party snipe them from the retreating ship as the demons teleport toward them. The Nalfeshnee board the ship and manage to knock out Salmur but barely touch the others. The party take out the pig demons one by one til the last one runs with Teririst chasing after it and finishes it off, grabbing a handful of demon dust in the process. 

The ship checks in with the dragons and Abishai in the centre before swinging back out to the cliffs. A swarm of Dybbuk float up egged on by snake like multi-armed sword wielding Marileth. The party deal with several waves of the floating undead like demons, with only a single corpse link creature making into the ships hold once again. The ship swings back toward the cliff with the Marileth near the top …

The Marileth charge over the cliff top into the army in pairs like 6-armed threshing machines, grappling infantry with their tails and dragging them over the cliff. Teririst convinces the Nightmares to catch the falling soldiers, with the risen devils helping. Aspalex comes abreast the cliff and the party leap into engage the windmilling sword-snake-women. Aspalex/Akaanvaaerd turns and breathes fire at another pair of Marileth surrounded by the army, who are fortunately all immune to fire as natives of the plane. The Marileth cut a path through the lines, dragging more damage before falling back down through the portal.

The dragon-ship goes back to patrol, and an eerie silence fills the night, for longer than any time since the ritual started. All the patrollers check in, the dragons, Abishai and our crew. News is the other armies approaching are Fire Giants, who may be attacking the demons streaming out into the plane, or worse, herding them back against the efreet army.

The unnatural still is broken by commotions in the army at several places around the cliff top. The ship approaches the closest one to see random behaviour in the army, and some inside the ritual circles too. Azers, elementals and salamanders wander aimlessly, look dazed or even start attacking each other with no apparent enemy in sight. Farlian is woken up and manages to spot a dark fungus or lichen in a crevass, which is promptly bathed in fire from Aspalex and the efreet. Thoric Sends a message to the general, to warn the army to check the other fissures around the Vent. In due course these can be seen being fire-cleansed in the darkness across the pit.

The roaming vigil continues, and clumps of darkness prove to be winged nightcrawling Nabassu, which Aspalex/Akaanvaerd is now just able to keep in front of as the ballistae and bows wear down. The chase is led over the chain as a trap to zap the last few demons, one of which decides to attack the adamantium links with teeth and claws.

The black winged demon nearly succeeds too, wearing it to threads of metal as the crew finish the other Nabassu and swing back around while Thoric wings his boots over to grab the chain as a backstop.

A horde of smaller winged Shadow Demons flock up and are dealt with similarly, although these are able to pass through the ships hull and attack the resting deckhands while in their hammocks before being sent back to the Abyss.

Two long hours of ritual casting remain, as the army wearily hopes to make it to the dawn.

The massive portal shimmers more deeply and swirls faster, its edges appearing to undulate, as a palpable energy can be felt pulsing rhythmically along the chain.

What demon powers could have sent so many fiends, what motives could they have behind this?

And are the Fire Giant army a helping hand? Or a coup de grace?

Session 32

The party move into repair mode, with Leon and Teririst on White Socks and Smoky Joe hauling up hanging chain ends to meet taut for Thoric to mend. After a few slips they call in another pair of Nightmares to help, with Teririst holding the Immovable Rod once one is in place. The party makes a full pass around the Vent and manages to repair all the trailing chains they find. Thoric hangs back on the second last mount point to recast Forbiddance on the chain while the four Nightmares press on to the last one with mending stored in a ring. 

Some of the ritual circles have been lost, and in passing an empty section of cliff as they return to the ship, Teririst and Leon see a large fiend with winged ears and a cloak over one arm waving them in. They move closer, curious, and the yagnoloth speaks telepathically: "Greetings, powerful creatures. My master Uqwn Ruby has sent me to see if I can interest you in the services of our yugoloth army?" 

Leon and Teririst quickly find the standard asking price to be a cartful of gold, but other equivalent options may suffice, like an unspecified number of souls. They bid the fiend mount a Nightmare behind Teririst and escort the yagnoloth, whose name is Umonth Trapper, back to the general.

The camp appears empty apart from the overrun medical tent, with swathes of tents in tatters where something trampled through. General Abd Multahib and his aides are in the command tent poring over a large map, Umonth restates the offer, and despite Leon’s most charming impression the fiend cannot offer credit – it’s ultraloth master will only take gold upfront as “dead armies can’t pay their debts”. The Sultan is contacted but cannot arrange this sum to arrive within the timeframe, nor even the lesser sum to stay out of the battle. Umonth offers to let the group discuss the offer and wanders off. 

Gargepore and Lt. Farew advise the rate is fair although they should insist on veterans and no mezzaloths.

They also comment that the fiend should not be left to scout their camp as they may sell the information to the other side. Leon and Teririst follow in the direction it left in, to the end of a row of tents then off to the right towards a pile of rocks near the cliff edge. Umonth finds these quite fascinating and folding his cloak in half starts piling it full of rounded, ordinary looking rocks. Teririst suddenly realises in a flash of inspiration that these are rough diamonds, and the Vent is a giant pipe volcano. Umonth is no longer interested in bartering, and with a full makeshift cape/sack teleports a short hop towards the cliff edge. Leon calls out and Commands Umonth to grovel, which he immediately does, letting Teririst catch up and pin the fiend down.

Umonth is led chastened back to the command tent to write out the contract for two sacks of diamonds with the risen devils closely attending. The general looks genuinely shocked to find the diamonds right under their noses all along. Two thousand veteran yugoloths are promised in an hour, which while it may be after the ritual is due to end is at least out of the hands of the demons.

The party return to patrol on the ship. As the dawn rises and the portal swirls and pulses even faster a massive swarm of different kinds of demons rise up the walls with a particularly large number to the east, with pairs of Nabassu flying up toward the chains. The ship takes out two Nabassu with the ballista, but this left time for two more to attack the chain a segment away. The party speed ahead of the ship on Nightmares to take them out before they can slash through. Felparizin and the smaller two dragons likewise deal with the other Nabassu, then Felparizin, the ship and crew all move toward the horde of demons on the east wall.

Fire Giants lob boulders into the army, and drive demons toward them too as Felparizin bathes the demons in fire from three hundred feet away, and the efreeti use their last walls of fire to erase the weaker demons, leaving six six-armed Marileth snake women guarding the demon lord Demogorgon. The sword demons crest the cliff wall and tear through the army, leaving Demogorgon to dispel the Hallow, then Forbiddance, and then send the efreet crazy, confused or stunned. Felparizin, knowing the fire plane natives immune, washes them all in flames again and again, although even he keeps a safe distance. The party hesitatingly move in and Leon sends in a spiritual weapon, while the ship bombards the demon lord with the ballista. Gargepore tells Thoric and Leon to remember this when he appeals to their gods for sanctuary and charges Demogorgon with Lt Farew on their Nightmares although the lances miss, before they shift into the Ethereal plane. Two pairs of Marileth split off to break the chain back-up guy-wires. Thoric calls convincingly for divine assistance, to no immediate effect, although still banishes a Marileth, and nearly banishes Demogorgon before averting his gaze from the maddening glare. Finally, Virtu and Teririst finish off the demon lord from range. The remaining heavily injured Marileth have no reason to keep fighting against these odds and exit via a cliff dive into the portal to the Abyss.

Enough of the chain holds, and the Gate Seal ritual is finally completed. The portal swirls faster and shrinks into nothing, and the army collectively breathes a sigh of relief. 

The Yugoloth army arrive via a gate near the camp. Umonth states their side of the contract is fulfilled and asks for orders. The general points to the Fire Giants remaining, and the fiends fly into action without hesitation. 

Inspecting the newly open Vent the party see an ash and lava strewn bowl shape below where the giant portal was, with a gargantuan juggernaut of molten rock roaring in defiance.

The Vent is revealed as a cradle for the scion of Surtur, God of Fire Giants. The party wonder again if they and the massive elemental are friend, foe, or just trying to regain their home. The Nightmares drop their heads, exhausted, and the sporadic remains of the army steels itself for a final standoff.

Session 33

The yugoloth move into engage one of the three battalions of fire giants, while the efreet and dragons start picking up boulders and dropping them on the giants from a height safe from boulders thrown back. The fire giants are unnervingly accurate, empowered by the nearby Cradle of the Fire Giant Scion. The Cradle itself lumbers roaring like a bonfire around the volcano's caldera, stirring it into a frenzy of ring-shaped eruptions each marked with a woomphing crack like thunder. Red hot rocks sized from pebbles to wagons are sent flying into the sky in a symmetrical outward arcing fountain of lava bombs, hitting anything and everything for miles. Teririst dodges one with a smell of burnt hair, and Thoric seems to attract them like a magnet, being thumped several times.

Thoric plans to use a new spell learned in the battle to summon a celestial pillar of radiance and maintain control via sight of it safely from the Ethereal plane with Red Lightning’s help. The risen devils are eager to meet this celestial and flank Thoric along with Leon ready to charge in with their lances and stride into the Ethereal to avoid being hit too. This strategy proves highly effective as long as the fire giants don’t notice them reappearing for another charge and pummel them with boulders. Thoric barely maintains concentration on the spell as he shifts planes, then proceeds to sear the fire giants front line and heal the yugoloths who still flinch from the radiance in expectation of pain. The fire giants are slow to realise the danger and take massive casualties before trying to scatter, too late as Thoric guides the beam around the battlefield, finally blasting the unruly herd of assorted demons away too.

Two more battalions of giants batter the fire elemental infantry at different points across the Vent. The party and the mostly intact yugoloths move toward the next skirmish closest to the camp, as the harried infantry fight a rearguard action.

Teririst and Farlian continue to snipe away with the ballista, as Thoric, Leon and the risen devils prepare to charge in again. Thoric carefully lines up Spirit Guardians just out of sword reach along the fire giants line and Red Lightning tries to thread this needle at full speed. This deals much more damage than Thoric and his nightmare take back from jumping sword strikes and following boulders. They refine this technique over multiple passes, taking healing to continue from the devils in the safe ethereal moments, and a quick trip back to Aspalex for some healing from Salmur and the druid. A quarter of the original yugoloths remain as the battalion is dealt with and the final force engaged. Thoric and Gargepore make a few more passes before disengaging honourably at the limit of their damage capacity. Leon and Lt. Farew hold out til the end and even spot a possible leader with a familiar looking Imix sceptre, although once the final yugoloths and infantry fall there seems little reason to risk melee again. The dragons and efreet continue to drop boulders, possibly highly valuable, onto the giants as the giants move toward the Vent cliff edge. As they approach it erupts like a wall of smoky glowing rocks, gone again to the sky in a fraction of a second, taking a few incautious efreet with it. The giants staring rapidly scaling down the cliff regardless. The lauth of dragons seize their moment to burrow a wedge shape into the cliff top and create a small avalanche on the few hundred remaining giants. A pile of rubble at the cliff toe scree slope can be seen with giants strewn amongst it like a collapsed ant's nest.

A final cinder bomb strikes Thoric moments later, knocking him out cold. Leon heals him just enough to limp back to the dragonship.

The third of the original army left is more than happy to leave the remaining giants with their Scions Cradle to die, or live in the volcano and decamp to a safe distance from the showers of stones from the sky.

As they breakdown the tents at record speed, the General names the party honorary Angels of Death. Gargepore thumps his thigh with his fist and shouts "Excellent!"

Date X+97

Session 34

The three dragons confer seriously in draconian as the party approach to thank them. Thoric hears them planning to take the Vent and its diamonds to create secondary lairs. Felparizin laughs and scoffs "secondary!". They agree the threat of the remaining fire giants and the Cradle of the Fire Scion cannot be allowed to remain, and agree to continue their lauth and return in two weeks before the giants can fortify the area.  Felparizin looks at the party and asks if they want into this fight, and they quickly agree. Thoric thanks Felparizin who graciously accepts flattery, and states he’ll remember their assistance in his ascension, and suggests they be wary with Akaanvaerd. Virtue asks Feldspar for information on powerful artefacts and the party and Felparizin also share their lore of items of legend. Halva was a singular mortal to the dragons, with the Helm, as well as armour and a horn known to be instruments of his success. Rebolon the Swearing Sword, the Luck Blade, the Tomes of the Stilled Tongue and the Dread Star the party already know, and the names of the unsettling Red Claw, the amazingly useful Cup of Clear, the handy Wrist Clock and the mysterious Planar Scalpel are offered and recognised from songs and tales of old.

Teririst leads the party in grabbing rough diamonds from the loose rocks with Thorics help on what to look for. The dragons also grab unclaimed tents as giant improvised sacks and shovel likely rocks into them before launching into the air and away from the ongoing lava bombing, the gem dragons to the south roughly toward the City of Brass and Felparizin to the east and the Fountains of Creation volcanic range. 

Thoric braves the edge of the vent to reclaim a length of adamant chain, with the Nightmares help to dodge lava bombs in the Ethereal plane, noticing he has developed a limp along the way.

All board the ship and launch for the City of Brass, dodging lava bombs surprisingly well for a large target.

Aspalex/Akaanvaerd lags behind the nightmare cavalry, and the party all gratefully rest below deck for first time since the battle started. The army lands at night to rest, letting the ship catch up. The voyage back allows some repairs, feasts and crafting. Thoric returns to providing Heroes Feasts, which the Nightmares indulge in, reminding some of their battlefield scavenging gusto. Virtu contacts unknown grandees on the angelic planes, finding hope for the devils at the pinnacle of Mt Celestia of the Seven Heavens, or perhaps with one of the Storm Kings of Arcadia in their high castles. He also asks for leads on the artefacts the dragons mentioned and is told Mayber von Tollant of Goldspire can assist with the Red Claw, and to ask the Collector in Port Hope about the Cup of Clear. Halva’s soul is also revealed to be in his helm. Sending engages Mayber in research, who is willing to simply trade for information. He also mentions the Goldspire representatives who survived the battle acquitted themselves with honour.

Teririst persists in training Smoky Joe to lower his flames even more to produce enough smoke to hide himself when still, and then summons a flying fire snake familiar, who he calls Sizzles.

Date X+99

The next night the watch spots some Wraiths approaching. Leon charges in and smites them mightily while Teririst snipes with the ballista Thoric blesses and Virtu hits them with vicious sorceries. A wraith drains Leon slightly before being shredded to mist, and the rest are turned to smoke too without landing another touch before Thoric turns the final one away into the hot hazy night.

The next day brings the City of Brass into view. News of the victory, and the parties involved has reached here with the casters gating back three days ago. The city gates show a ragged stream of giants leaving, carrying only sacks with the occasional cart, being harried by crowds of smaller denizens while the guards watch impassively from the walls.

Date X+100

The dragonskiff follows the army into the naval docks and berths in the higher levels above the lava with other flying craft. The party plan their next moves. Thoric has fabricated the rough diamonds into cut ones, and a ceremonial adamant sword for the Sultan. Teririst makes designs on the Luck Blade in Weapons of Thunder and Awe, where Leon reminds him an Iron Golem guards it. Gargepore and Lt. Farew express interest in visiting their palazzo but are hesitant to move through the city openly. Teririst & Leon discuss ways to disguise them as efreet and decide Leon should ask the quartermaster. As Angels they & their nightmares are freely given armour from the pile returned from the battle, quickly burned clean of bloodstains, and assisted with fitting. Teririst finishes the look with a disguise kit.

The new Angels ride into the city, first to the Charcoal Palace, where the devils wisely stay with the steeds. The heroes request an audience and are directed to join the queue of supplicants. The Sultan moves through business quickly and with little mercy or concern for the people, deciding business and political disputes with an iron fist on any power or influence doled out and a sharp nose for keeping both parties equally unhappy. Many issues involve fighting over the ransacked temples of Imix and Surtr, and riots involving fire giants, which he seems unconcerned about.

Seeing our heroes he nudges an aide, who whispers into his ear while looking at each one by one, before the Sultan greets them all by name and calls for ceremonial armour befitting their new rank for the grand parade in two days. A detailed and glorious account of the battle stuns the courtiers, and the Sultan asks after their Nightmares by name which he seems to know without prompting and is impressed with Teririst’s training results. The party are invited to a polo match tomorrow and told the race at the Maidan has been rescheduled for seven days.

Thoric’s gift of the sword made of the chain that sealed the Vent gate is very well received. They are welcomed to the barracks and offered introductions to other nobles with calculating looks if Dahlia & Miraz Amak are not to their convenience and liking. After the audience several courtiers sidle up to them, seeking attention or reflected influence. One asks about devils they may have seen, expressing surprise the Baatezu were not involved. Leon only lets on about the Abishai squad and the yugoloth mercenaries.

A grizzled efreet veteran offers to adjust their impressive looking new black, red & gold armour to fit and so the sharp flamelike curlique spauldrons don’t stab them in the armpits. He also gives advice on weaponry stores when asked and introduces himself as Exounth Ironhide after telling them about his possibly wise disaster preparation efforts.

  
The party leave the stifling heat of the Charcoal Palace, making their way past the Breath of the Sultan, the giant purple flame fountain marking the fact that the Sultan lives.

Returning to their black flaming horses and fellow Angel devils, the party ride like the heroes they are through the busy streets unfettered. Commoners of the city, of all kinds of elemental make way, stare, whisper behind their hands, point and talk of them excitedly. Sizzles whips through the crowd in arcs trailing sparks, delighting the efreet children.

At the Palazzo of the Blue Horse, they see a street crowd angrily arguing with Dahlia in the door, exclaiming "they’re not fire giants anymore, they’re skeletons!". No sense is being made by the rabble, and Dahlia is clearly exasperated. Leon steps forward and strike a righteous note as he declares to the crowd that the only good fire giant is a dead fire giant and he should know as he made a more than a few that way, and these ones are very dead. The crowd accepts this logic and more so the chance to get behind a hero with a pretty good slogan and move on loudly.

Dahlia is more than happy to have the heroes back, but not the disguised devils who she doesn’t recognise. Gargepore is happy to stay elsewhere, requesting only an escort to his Palazzo of Silk in case of "issues". Dahlia asks if they can do a shopping run from the market as Miraz is busy as physician with the returned army at the barracks and she can’t send out the giant skeleton guards, providing a list of what appears to food and some coins.

The Angels ride back once more into the buzz and bustle of the Pyraculum, the greatest bazaar in the known multiverse …

Session 35

The party go to the run-down Palazzo of Silk, and from the end of the street notice the Merregon guards are not at the gate. Rather than walk into an ambush, Thoric starts casting Forbiddance on the compound from the roadside wall. Teririst provides cover with a Silent Image, which works when an Orthon bounty hunter devil looks around the corner. Aargh provides a distraction from a distance with the Orthon keeping an eye on him from the street corner until Virtu casts Banishment, needing only a minute to concentrate to complete sending it back to its home in one of the Nine Hells.

Yelling and commotion starts inside the compound when the spell takes effect, which dies down slowly.

The party are suddenly clouded in fog, which Thoric dispels to see an ape-like Bargura and two Dogai assassins. Aargh wrestles and pins the Barlgura to the ground while Virtu stuns it with Ralathims Psychic Lance. The risen devils charge to engage the Dogai, who dodge most attacks with incredible litheness, but are less proof against their terrifying command and one runs and turns invisible again. Another hulking Orthon appears behind the party to blast them all with hellfire from its strange bone and brass crossbow. Virtu maintains concentration on banishing its partner through the searing pain.

The party wear down an Orthon together. Leon is everywhere, attacking all of the goes in turn and with a quick casting is the only party member who can see the invisible Dogai. He mounts White Socks to launch over the melee and block the Dogai's escape, managing to knock it back through the Silk compound gate into the Forbiddance zone again. 

The last Dogai fails to sneak attack Lt. Farew even with invisibility and decides to teleport away.

The devils find all their Merregon guards dead, returned to the Hells as lemures, and clear their remaining possessions from the compound, never to return. 

From the stables they offer the party Infernal Tack, which are magical summoning spurs for Nightmares.

The devils decline to go through the Pyraculum markets and return to the safety of the barracks for a few days. The party are lured by the magic shops eager to spend their newfound diamond wealth. After Aargh spends a small fortune at Afends Magic Emporium, Afends offers the party the chance to see the "discerning customer's room" for 10,000 gold pieces. Virtu provides the entry fee in one gem, and Afends casts Gate to a crystal cavern guarded by a crystal golem in a demi-plane holding only a small bench/cabinet. Afends fusses with the drawer for a minute before pulling out several legendary elemental summoning rings (but not Fire elementals) and other items for the party to choose from including a belt of Storm Giant strength Thoric claims, to make even more legendary deeds with. Leon says diplomatically he sees nothing for paladins and is offered three leads on the whereabouts of Holy Avengers, for a small price of 5,000 gold. 

Teririst holds his money for the Luck Blade he's been considering stealing from Weapons of Thunder and Awe. He drives a hard bargain with Leons help, with an Iron Golem   looming behind him. The blade is even removed from the glass block containing it for demonstration purposes, and before Teririst can consider bolting with it the dagger is back no longer in his hands.

The deal is done, and the party complete the rest of their shopping.

Aargh throws a would-be pickpocket into a wall. The party are keenly aware of their new reputation and realise this will not be the last.

Returning back to the Palazzo of the Blue Horse, they are greeted with relief and appreciation, and a heroes feast is had within the walls and the newly famous heroes sleep peacefully on clean fireweed in the stables wondering how long this will last with their list of foes and envious opportunists growing longer every day.

Date X+101

Session 36

The party wake in the Blue Horse Palazzo and discuss polo with their hosts the Amaks. The puck is a delayed blast fireball crystal, and the teams use their choice of flat bladed polearms: glaives, guisarmes, bardiches, voulge, partisans etc. The team's have a minute to score before it explodes. 

Approaching along the Street of Stelae they notice the pillars lining the street celebrate historical victories, and a new mural is being added to one. The street ends at the Gate of the Fallen, which lists the vanquished enemies of the efreet. 

At the back of the palace grounds, there is an argument and a commotion outside the Temple of Imix. Aargh's sceptre is noticed by some of them who point and gesticulate.

Ignoring this the move to the parade ground and find their Fireball 5 squadron ready to face the dilettante 1st Lancers.

The game is brutal and fast paced. Mishandling the puck causes triggers the fireball which everyone except the party finds amusing. Teririst picks up the puck and the runs the gauntlet through the defence to throw the puck between the posts for a squadmate to setoff with a glaive.

Thoric blasts the conveniently grouped opponents while healing teammates, and the opposition take advantage of the party's lack of fire immunity by summoning fire elementals and walls of fire.

Aargh convinces an opponents mount with food and a ring to take a city excursion instead of playing the game. The rider comes back mountless after missing some of the action.

Teririst scores two goals by dodging through the attacks, and Aargh throws a shot just short of the goal, to then push it over with the Ring of the Ram.  

Soon the Lancers are behind on the scoreboard 5-0 but more importantly they are running out of players, and even the subs aren't safe as Teririst wipes the bench clean.

Leon decides to run roughshod over the opposition he blinded, with a summoned rhinoceros.

The rout is complete when the last few Lancers skip into the Ethereal plan where Thoric hunts them into oblivion. 

The melee continues briefly until the referee sees the final downed Lancers return to the Plane of Fire, and the out-of-control fire elementals are banished elsewhere in the plane.

The victorious team graciously heal their opponents and bask in the victory to the delight of the audience of efreet nobles and one or two devils.

Session 37

The Sultan throws a feast for the victorious team, and fire-water flows freely, which the heroes find much harder to drink than the efreet. Deals are made and influence peddled, and the party find several familiar faces among the crowd. The Amak’s bask in reflected glory of their patronage, the General tries to catch their eyes, the veteran Exounth Ironhide nods approvingly and the yugoloth Umonth Trapper has gained the favour of the court over a pair of what can only be devil emissaries. 

The party witness an efreet choking and spluttering on his fire-water then suddenly violently extrude iron spikes in all directions before falling dead. Investigation shows the cup is magic and has cast Shape Metal. Most efreet are ambivalent and some are even pleased by the event, and when Thoric balls the iron up and removes it then raises the efreet some appear annoyed, one more than most. Leon confronts this efreet, but apart from acknowledging a contract dispute he bluntly states there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Teririst suggests a trade discount to the revivified merchant, who turns out to deal in spices and is happy to be quickly and relatively cheaply rid of an unasked-for obligation, and glad to find some new trade routes. The party name Kelph of the City of Gems and Starforge as trading posts, and their new business partner suggests a meeting at his office in the markets to sign a contract.

General Abd Multahib seems puzzled at their generosity in reviving the trader yet acknowledges it has benefited them overall. He asks what they think of their opponents in polo and war compatriots the 1st Lancers, and offers the party a commission as leaders of the outfit to "whip them into shape", while retaking the Vent before the Fire Giants fortify the position. The party discuss among themselves and Thoric sends to Felparizin to avoid any misunderstandings.

The greatwyrm states clear terms: equal fifth shares for the dragons, the party and the army in the spoils of battle with the dragons only claiming the Vent. Thoric passes this on to the General who accepts pending the Sultans approval, claiming no interest in the giant hole and active volcano. The general gently schools Thoric in care with intelligence sharing however, again noting this was a good outcome.

Thoric remembers Sippervetak as a warrior trainer from Weyrhold, who was named as a red dragon, and sends to him asking for help with the Lancers. Sippervetak’s answer ends in "turn around", which they do to see him plane shift in- just as they remember, a burly human drill sergeant in red scale mail. Sippervetak apprises them of the declining situation in Corus Vale and agrees to stay the week. He wastes no time in seconding Salmur and immediately rounds up the Lancers looking hopefully at the feast and puts them to work on the field with loud and creative insults. General Abd Multahib approves and moves off to see the Sultan. 

A sibilant voice from a very large devil with relatively small bat wings introduces themselves as Sazerac, a Paeliryon devil, and her assistant Alirya an Erinyes. She has followed the party with great interest and notes they are collecting powerful enemies - Demogorgon, Imix, Surtr and Vecna. She says the war at the Vent took demonic resources away from Avernus and gave the devils an advantage in reclaiming territory in the Blood War. She offers some free advice, and to trade for power, gold, influence “or anything at all really darlings. We always need warm bodies to protect the multiverse in the Blood War".

She mentions that the Vent will always be at risk of the portal re-opening to the Gaping Maw and will need watching, and to Teririst that mages will be the likely keepers of Tomes of the Stilled Tongue. Artefacts like these hold a small piece of the deities that create them.

Umonth approaches - he and Sazerac bicker about supplying troops and competing for influence, and Sazerac brags about devil achievements.

Teririst asks the match referee Jamina about fire spells - she mentions several and demonstrates one. Thoric is also interested and gains an invite to her workshop in the smithing and smelting district, which in ejecting fire giant smiths has dropped production.

Exounth Ironhide approves of taking the Lancer lead commission and recommends watching their backs. He casually mentions he is Lord of the Castle of the Sun & Moon, one of the 3 forts in the city.

A kerfuffle breaks out at a table with sheets of densely written foil parchment being signed as one efreet suddenly yelps loudly, swirls into a thick grey mist and is sucked into an iron flask. The efreet seated opposite pulls another sheet of parchment from under the one on top and waves it to the crowd triumphantly yelling "He signed it!".  Someone nearby comments knowingly "Understanding what you sign is not a requirement ". 

The party move to leave, and the Miraz’s make their farewells. Teririst notices a pixie in a cage and immediately decides to rescue it. He deftly picks the lock, opens the door and swaps the pixie for a prestidigitated illusion. Looking to mark a patsy he asks the pixie ("Hibby!") for a shoe which she obliges with. Teririst fumbles the first evidence planting attempt and drops the tiny shoe next to the iron poisoner from earlier in the evening. He grunts and shoves Teririst away, not noticing the minuscule footwear. Teririst picks it up and this time drops the shoe into the smug murderous merchants pocket and also steals a signet ring right off his finger without it being noticed. The signet ring is dropped in the cage, only just before the missing pixie is noticed by a fascinated efreeta noble. She raises a concern loudly, and a guard comes over to investigate, finding the signet immediately. He presents it straight to the Sultan.

The Sultan is very annoyed at his exotic gift being pilfered and calls the unsuspecting merchant out by name - "Nemoa Archer!!!". The merchant is frogmarched in front of the Sultan and asked if the ring is his. Nemoa says forthrightly, "Yes, it is". The Sultan orders him searched, and the shoe drops from his pocket, to be held up by a guard triumphantly. The Sultan nods to the guard and the merchant's puzzled look is fixed on his face as his head falls off and hits the floor.

The party return to the Palazzo of the Blue Horse, and Thoric lays out a Heroes Feast. Hibiliminance the pixie plays with the children and Sizzles but avoids the fire giant skeletons with naked fear.

The party report early in the morning to the gate at the end of the Street of Stelae to marshall their new troops. Their former squadron, Fireball 5 acknowledge them and joke about their new troops. The Angels of Death form up in clean and regular lines with identical armour then march out in formation. The 1st Lancers meander about in their customised gear, some vying to be first, others chatting in groups, others wandering off to browse nearby shops and talk to the locals. Thoric blasts out a quick speech, and the squad leaders start to pull their troops together, and the Lancers march off in something approaching vaguely cohesive. The crowds wave and cheer, jostling to see, and the soldiers enjoy their moment. 

Going past the temple of Surtr, they see the only red greatwyrm they know glide in low and land on the dome. Ripping the roof apart he burrows in to the building, then emerges shortly after with a giant steel ball, covered in runes. Felparizin nods to the party then transforms into a giant Roc before flying off with the iron ball in his claws. The army and guards that see it blink in confusion, shake their heads and turn back to the parade. 

Sippervetak turns and notes this is an interesting place to be. Thoric catches him up on recent events and he is greatly impressed. 

The Street of Stelae ends near the Charcoal Palace, with a new war victory statue, showing the Vent, the efreet army, some fuzzy winged things and a very clear demon lord.

The army forms up in front of the palace where the Sultan makes a speech about his great victory with his great army (with no names mentioned) against Demogorgon.

The army is dismissed, and the heroes let the Lancers off for the day. Sippervetak quickly insists on all reporting for training at 1st light.

Dahlia recommends a lawyer for their trade contract meeting, who proves worth the money and a spice route is established to the City of Gems via Starforge on the boat of Captain Soot, with a healthy monthly commission of 450gp to be held at Starforge.

The party return to Aspalex, after letting Dahlia know they’ll stay the for the duration. She graciously thanks them for their time together and says they can return any time, while looking at Leon. The party decide they should ramp up their defences, sharpen their watch routines and set alarms and a guardian nightly.

A few days remain for the Maidan steeplechase, before leaving on the new Vent expedition with a green and self-centred fighting force.

Meanwhile - In the darkness and in the open spies spy, armies arm, cultists scheme and mad gods mutter the names of our heroes with frustration and enmity.

Session 38

Date X+102

Another orange dawn rises on the City of Brass. Farlian reports some suspicious activity at the edge of his field of view from the night watch, but nothing he can detail. The party get to the training fields to see Sippervetak marshalling the 1st Lancers into some form of order. The no-nonsense drill sergeant in his red scale mail spares none of the spoiled young nobles his tongue and looks perfectly happy doing it. He reports the legion are missing a leader or Wispuran, and have only 9 of 10 Wurzurgan, or section leaders of 100 troops, after a 2nd son by the name of Archer was called back to run the family estate after an untimely death at the Sultans feast yesterday. Various troops also need new or repaired gear after the battle of the Vent and the quartermaster has set a deadline for materiel requisition of tomorrow if needed for the next sortie in 6 days.

Uniform is discussed, and custom armour is agreed to be permitted as long it’s all painted/dyed black & gold with a charging rhino and a small section for house heraldry. Leon announces this to an approving legion and weapon and armour requests are made with Thoric making immediate repairs as needed. 

Sippervetak segues immediately into lance charging practice and the party join in enthusiastically. Teririst increases the difficulty level to the confusion of some lancers, as Sizzles dances and whips around like a ribbon. A small gold pixie is also charging and zooming around like a pretend furious moth, and Teririst quickly grabs her and places a brief illusion like she was an intended distraction before throwing the pixie in Leon’s direction. Hibby is grudgingly convinced to charge invisibly, which she does on the rhino. Half a day in the new leaders take their list to the armoury. Along the way a grubby efreet thief rifles through Smoky Joes saddlebags in the street without Teririst even noticing. Luckily they were empty and Thoric grabs the thief by the scruff of his neck and lifts him off the ground.

Thoric sees the city watch ahead and hails them. They hear the story and after a quick glance at the filthy street efreet summarily dispense justice with a scimitar through the thief’s left wrist and move on.

Back at the Keep of Fire Striking Steel they find they find the quartermaster behind a desk in the armoury. He asks for their commission, which has only been verbal so far. Despite their best efforts at convincing him, he can’t risk handing over anything without the proper paperwork and the party send to General Abd Multahib to finalise it, and also their lawyer who agrees to meet them at the palace in an hour. 

Thoric wants to detour via the Surtr temple ruins to see what Felparizin made off with. This isn’t far away so they stop in to find a round cradle in the back rooms of the temple. Thoric translates and notes down the wall art showing Surtr’s keen interest in forging and smithing, as well as depictions of the Vonindod, or runic colossus. This is familiar from the real example they saw in construction at Starforge.

The party move on toward the Charcoal Palace and notice a group of 4 black cloaked figures tailing them. They party move into a side alley and Teririst sets an illusion over the alley front as the party lay an ambush. The group turns out to be a fire giant, two efreet and a salamander wearing Imix pendants. The party cross swords with the cultists.  Salmur leads with cold breath which the salamander is susceptible to, Leon charges in with the rhino, which Teririst hides behind to strike with a booming blade. Thoric calls on the beam of radiance Summon Celestial to fry them all and heal the brutal punishment dealt beck by the cultists. The salamander and fire giant are dispatched quickly, and one efreet is laid unconscious. The last one unwisely tries to escape in gaseous form, to be commanded back to solid form by Leon and cuffed with dimensional shackles. The watch come to investigate the light and sounds and find the party looting away.

Seeing a dead fire giant and the Imix symbols though they overlook this, and the party take their captives on to the palace. 

The party meet with the general and their lawyer Gelax Endymion. The agreement is to clear the Vent of fire giants as the leaders of the 1st Lancers for a share of battlefield loot only. Success will keep them with official rank on any future visit to the Plane of Fire, and failure will result in discharge …

They toast the signed agreement with Fire wine and pay Gelax. The general also agrees to take the Imix cultists for questioning and the party skirt knowing the details.

Returning to the armoury they notice another tail behind. Teririst moves toward them, and they scatter and run. The party decide to fly above the streets to avoid the unwanted attention, with only cursory challenges from the city guard to slow them down.

Krechu Brickbridge the quartermaster efficiently fills out forms in triplicate once he sights their commission and sends them to the storeman Krask to fill their requisition. Krask supplies the gear and surreptitiously offers to show them some "better stuff" out the back for an underhand payment. These crates glow bright under a detect magic spell, and some negotiation leads to a mix of official and unofficial requests as the quartermaster authorises +1 magical gear for officers only, and the party put a down payment on a pair of black-market ballista. Some items aren’t in stock, and Krechu writes a purchase order to give to the smiths in the Street of Steel for these. The party fly over to the Char and Keffinspires districts, being warned off flying over the palace on the way. 

Lances are found and ordered, but longbows are an uncommon request and not available from the efreet smiths. 

  
The party visit Jemina’s workshop, who is pleased to give them a tour of what might be a red kobolds fantasyland - intricate clockwork birds and magical devices of flame, metal and obscure function.

Jemina is intrigued with the mini-gates and asks if she can keep one in the forge to study, and suggests the others could be dropped in the Sea of Fire, the Ash Dunes and the Fissures. The Great Conflagration is probably lethal to them though. She agrees to make some longbows, and to think about eldritch cannons large and small, security devices like alarms and claymores in exchange for rare metals from and an apprentice/knowledge swap with Starforge.

The party return to the dragon boat and their new nightly routine of setting guards and alarms. 

The rhino has returned as well after being left in the streets when they took flight. Leon is adamant it didn’t have a saddle before, which is good as it definitely doesn’t now.

Night falls on the City of Brass, the city where the fires never die, and power flows from today's leaders to the next like blood in the streets.

Session 39

A portal opens on deck from Goldspire to reveal Dug of the Battletractor dwarf clan, a wild dwarf with a beard wrapped around his spiked armour. Dug made the journey from Spetzstock on the eastern forest foothills of Corus Vale to seek help for his clan in defending their home against attack from the neighbouring kingdom of Ballantyre. Thoric offers him welcome as a fellow dwarf in spite of differences in gods and clan and lays out a hero's feast. Teririst persists in training Smoky Joe with the dripping gobs of meat the Nightmares favour.

Night fades in and Farlian takes watch in the crow's nest as the party and crew rest. Hours later, the alarm goes off and an arrow can be heard thunking into the deck. The Guardian of Faith lashes into action at two metal spider looking creatures which scuttle down the steep stairs into the hold. Teririst is already up and hiding as the two creatures stare searchingly in his direction, clicking their mandibles. The guard are heard calling out nearby to ask "Do you need help in there?"  The party decline and launch into action and all attack, with Teririst strikes from the shadows. The Retrievers lock onto Teririst as soon as he appears and both shoot yellow beams at him. Leon quickly casts a spell to assist Teririst dodge one beam, only to be paralysed by the other.

Realising these creatures will grab & plane shift him away, Teririst warns the party, who quickly search their gear for the dimensional shackles. Thoric has them after using them on their attackers yesterday and shackles the Tabaxi quickly before Teririst hides behind the dwarf cleric. Leon and Dug pound one Retriever back up the ladder into the Guardian of Faith and a broken pile of metal pieces to see a red wispy vapour dissipate from it. The other shoots a web in Teririst’s general direction which only catches Thoric, and closes in.

Dug found his attacks ineffective on these targets without magic, so Thoric assisted him with Magic Weapon, noting he’d need something better in future. The party decide to incapacitate the retrievers for information so Teririst grapples the remaining one for the others to attack, getting paralysed again for his efforts. The Retriever attempts to plane shift with its Tabaxi target, but the dimensional shackles cause the spell to fail - a shimmery portal shakes into view of a magical workshop full of scrolls, books in fiendish languages, alembics, retorts and other alchemical equipment, with a black robed figure leaning over the desk. The connection breaks leaving the Retriever to the party’s mercy, which is limited to knocking it unconscious.

Two efreet guards call out from the deck to ask if help is required. The party decline again, but before they can gain the deck the guards are down the ladder and looking very intently at the devils. Thoric and Teririst notice the guard's thumbs seem to be pointing the wrong way with their palms facing outwards. Gargepore shakes off a charm spell while Lt. Farew suddenly breaks into an incongruous smile. Gargepore yells out "Do NOT let them leave!". The party lay into the fake efreet guards, who try to dominate and charm the devils again. One is beaten into a pulp quickly and reveals its true form to be a tiger headed devil. Leon tries to taunt the other into surrendering, to get a reply "the bounty is too good!". The ‘efreet’ turns invisible and tries to flee with its valuable new information. Farlian spots the fleeing rakshasa on deck with his Robe of Eyes and calls out "Invisible creature on deck?".  Thoric calls out "Foe" in reply, and Farlian shoots with the longbow from the crow's nest, only to miss. Teririst rushes to the ballista but can’t see a target. Leon uses Divine Sense to locate the rakshasa who is immune to low level spells, chases it on deck and knocks the devil unconscious. 

The party set the devils to guard & keep the prisoners knocked out and while they rest, which the devils very keenly do. Thankfully the rest of the night is uneventful. They decide to shackle the Retriever and interrogate it first, which is a unique challenge as the only common language both understand is Abyssal, which only Virtu speaks. Even worse the construct lacks a mouth to speak, so they are restricted to one click for yes, two for no. They slowly ask/click to confirm that Teririst was the target, alive or dead, and the Retrievers master was a servant of Vecna, with a workshop they briefly saw on Cania, on the 8th layer of the Hells. It has no knowledge of its master’s motivations and stays silent on those questions. The bebilith souled construct was persuaded to stay by Leons insistence.

The Rakshasa was then dimensionally shackled and revived below deck. It was much more talkative and revealed it was after the bounty posted by the would-be risen devil's former masters, the Dark Eight. The bounty being promotion and a dozen soul coins - apparently no small beer. The pair of rakshasa bounty hunters had heard the party were near the last known location of the devils, their now abandoned palazzo, and had been stalking them invisibly from a distance for the last week. The retriever's incursion was simply an opportunity to check the hold unobtrusively.

The party leave the Rakshasa’s fate to Gargepore, who simply says "Enjoy being a lemure again" then runs it through.

A little later, as the party and crew clean up and prepare for the day, knocking is heard on the outside of the ship. An excited Jemina with an armful of large foil scrolls asks permission to come aboard. Granted this, once on deck she immediately asks to take the ship to her workshop to begin on some of her ideas, which she eagerly shows off on the large foil scrolls containing diagrams of animated ballista, earth elementals bound into metal tubes to make cannons, a boiling oil cauldron hung off the derrick, and other hastily scribbled diagrams. She has also apparently been in a lot of discussion with Mayber Von Tollant of Goldspire, and frustratedly asks for help to persuade him to relinquish several items of interest, which turn out to be all cursed or evil: the Archmagi robe, demon armour, and not least the Tomes of the Stilled Tongue which she claims Mayber is not suited to handle and expresses great concern. The party agree there is likely a trade to be made for the items, except for the Stilled Tongue tomes which may be read only at Goldspire.

She also offers to help build their iron golem from its tome but claims no skill or interest in the clay or stone ones.


The party agree to relocation of the ship as a prudent idea and fly it over to Jeminas workshop sending the quartermaster a message of their location for the new ballista delivery. It does not quite fit but Jemina urges them on as the scaled masts and spars clear shelves on both sides clattering assorted bronze and brass equipment to the ground with acolytes racing to pick them up. The great metal doors glide smoothly and silently shut behind them, and the party feel a sense of relief, asking to stay on board ship during the works. Jemina agrees, seeing no need to access the hold. 

She also offers them the clockwork bird as a guard, which turns out to function as a Lantern of Revealing.

Thoric casts Planar Binding to take over firm control of the Retriever, which Jemina approves of and also requests the spare parts of its partner and it if it should expire. 

Surviving through the night has never seemed so uncertain and the relief is palpable yet unstable for the long term.

The party prepare to face the morning, foes known and yet unknown and more immediately a second day of lancer training on the parade grounds of the City of Brass.

Date X+103

Session 40

The party face the auburn morning of the City of Brass with high expectations tempered with a little more caution now, and note more black and gold uniforms appearing on the Lancers turned out ready for training. Sippervetak barks out drill orders and the Lancers vie to outdo each other. Leon notices a tiny squeak as his lance hits the target, followed by a faint and high-pitched song about charging and lancing. The squeaks draw a few looks from the lancers and suggestions on oiling tack and harness.

At the end of the of the session Dahlia is waiting for them, with news their share of carapace has been delivered to her palazzo by the knacker Ali Ben Azarf. Dahlia kindly offers to arrange a pair of carts tomorrow afternoon to deliver it on to the workshop. She also idly offers to show Leon a fire sauna but suggests he’ll need fire immunity. 

Virtu takes Hibby back to the workshop to practice glassblowing, while Thoric and Leon soar through the swirling thermals over the city and gliding down just above the roiling lava surface Sea of Fire to drop a mini gate, wisely away from frolicking salamanders. The magical gate sits on the surface briefly before submerging slowly into the glowing red sea. 

A productive and calm evening is spent at the workshop, with Thoric comparing forging notes with the ateliery acolytes and firming trade details. The party set the new standard security details and settle in for the night.

Leon wakes to a scuffle in the street outside and investigates to see a pack of salamanders scrapping with the city guard. Thoric joins him and hears via his comprehending helm the cry "Death to the Sultan" in Ignan. Thoric lights up the night with a beam of Daylight, while Leon charges in to lance one from a safe distance, followed by his rhino. The salamander grapples Leon using its searing hot tail and yet fails to do more than cook Leon slowly. The rhino takes a nasty hit, and Thoric throws his hammer about.

The salamanders are beaten down one by one, with the two Myrmidon guards taking the first one out together. Leon’s tail hugger thrashes uselessly and fails to leave the daylight circle, frying in the radiance. The rhino circles around to charge another down, and the last three salamanders try to flee in different directions. They’re slower than all but Thoric though, and even he casts a spell to appear in front of two of them. Leon chases the other down and takes it out while Thoric and a guard finish one of their pair. The last salamander ducks and weaves to avoid its fate. The rhino charges back the way it came and further towards the final spear wielding fire lizard, then Leon launches off it and traps the unwitting creature in a compelled duel and fear sandwich, forcing it to dash nowhere and burning out its feeble mind slowly into a quivering mess in Torms aura of unyielding righteousness. The guards stand by looking at this scene nervously, thanking Leon and Thoric for the help while edging slightly away.

The night passes quietly after that.

Date X+104

Orange and gold dawn burns bright as the party fly back to the training ground. More uniforms appear again on the Lancers and the party launch into another charging session. Leon is resigned to hear more joyous squeaking from his pommel and gives up trying to convince the pixie to be quiet. The Lancers are more interested in competing to best each others efforts and talking about the rumours of the rhino charge and the salamander rebel mind melting takedown last night. Sippervetak keeps a stern face yet manages to convey slight approval of their progress. 

Past noon and the party meet Dahlia at the Blue Horse Palazzo, where the fire giant skeletons are loading the highly reflective carapace onto two flat tray wagons led by an Azer each driving a skeleton warhorse. The giants throw a tarpaulin over the load, and Thoric decides to set a spirit guardian on each wagon. Unfortunately, one of the undead horses was hostile to Thoric and the guardian puts it down right in its traces as it rears and kicks its legs in the air, lashing out at the unseen enemy. The Azer owner is visibly upset, demanding reparations. Leon hitches up the rhino to get the load moving, which the Azer seems quite happy with.

The party moves out, guarding their load. Virtu notices they have a tail in the form of three hooded figures and alerts the others.  Leon picks his moment as they round a corner to stride into the Ethereal plane with White Socks, and hangs back to see the misty outlines of their new followers from the parallel plane. They keep their distance right to the workshop, where two of the cloaked figures set up unobtrusive watching positions around a hundred yards away in opposite ends of the street, pretending to look at nearby stalls but not engaging with the merchants.

The Tarrasque hide is unloaded and Thoric asks Jemina to translate for him to resolve the now dead undead horse problem, which the going rate of gold solves to the Azers satisfaction.

  
The empty wagons are hitched together and move off. As the party move into the workshop, the third cloaked figure moves off, and Leon decides to follow it ethereally. It moves into the Avencina district, through some desperate, dubious and dangerous looking neighbourhoods finally into the Rebel Rubble. Pulling back a broken door reveals a rough tunnel entry into a set of catacombs with mysterious symbols on the walls. Leon starts to take notes of the layout to memory before a very large, tentacled shadow passes overhead, which he is shocked to realise is in the Ethereal plane with him. He convinces White Socks to hide them in a puff of smoke, thankful that they both paid some passing attention to Teririst and Smoky Joe’s practice efforts.

They decide to leave quickly, and after a block go back to the Plane of Fire and trot through the streets as fast as the can back to the workshop. 

Leon draws a picture for the crew, the gith quickly identify the squid-like ship as a nautiloid, likely piloted by mindflayers, which they are very keen to call in the red dragon cavalry on.

Thoric sends to General biz Alizard, who presses for details and asks if the nightmare riders of the 1st Lancers are ready. The party affirm this and are given marching orders to defend as necessary or ensure the ship clears the city limits. 

Our heroes step yet again to the cusp of astounding things, and endless possibilities. Great powers, planar fame, singular artefacts call, dogged always by the risks of crippling failure, humiliating slavery, and brutal pogroms.

Session 41

The party mobilise, with Leon and Teririst riding ahead of the ship to call up the Lancers. They touch down on the parade grounds to see training done for the day. Going through the barracks they find Sippervetak not in his room. A nearby Lancer suggests he might be at Firefist Alley dueling grounds or the Burnt Bean coffeehouse. Leon orders all the Lancers to the parade grounds and sets off, first to find no-one they know at Firefist Alley. Going further to Avencina they find the Burnt Bean and Teririst orders a coffee, asking for a discount as an Angel of Death and despite getting the best coffee of his life half price, sneaking out anyway. Leon denies any involvement with him and sits down with Sippervetak to explain the situation. The warrior finishes his cup and puts down five silver before getting up.

They all head back to the parade grounds to find the ship and most of the Lancers ready. They briefly discuss strategy realising the Nightmare riders can assist the riders of other beasts into the Ethereal. Aspalex leads the Lancers in a conical Flying V around through Avencina again into Keffinspires following in the direction the Nautiloid was last seen. Aspalex plane shifts with a crackling snap, followed by the Nightmares smooth stride into the misty grey Ethereal.

Visibility is limited, yet with Farlian’s Robe of Eyes they plow ahead at full speed into the mist, and the shadows of the Azer towers of Keffinspires.

Soon enough the nautiloid appears, and Virtu hails it. The response is incoherent telepathic emotion without words; angst, pain, loneliness and a desire to be free of the bad things. Looking closely the party see the giant shelled squid is injured, with a damaged deck mounted to its shell. The rubbery skin appears to be crawling with small, clawed brains.

The Lancers and ballista pick off the brains from range, while Thoric and Farlian stride out of the Ethereal and through its corresponding position in the Plane of Fire. Farlian looks into the Ethereal, inside the Nautiloid’s shell and deck to see it nearly filled with a gargantuan worm like creature.  The nautiloid flails toward Aspalex as a fellow nautiloid sentience, yet the party steer just clear. They take this news back to the Ethereal and the ship, to see the intellect devourers all pin-cushioned and fried. Virtu feels an instant tug in his mind he staunchly rejects. Leon lands on the deck, in front of a looming dark entryway. Teririst hovers next the nautiloid on Smoky Joe, and Aargh jumps aboard and straight into the ship, to find the worm and lay into it, followed by the party, with Thoric frying it with divine radiance.

The beast is slain, and examination shows it to be a Neothelid, an abomination even to mindflayers, grown from one of their tadpoles and eventually taking over and eating or crushing everything in reach. Thoric and Aargh heave the slimy corpse out a few feet at a time, and then carefully explore the ruined interior, frying a few remaining brain-dogs.

The deck is a flattened mess of unrecognisable fleshy alien technology, covered in slime and pools of filth. They emerge to find the nautiloid has grappled Aspalex in its tentacles, snaking one into the hold. Uncomfortably, and awkwardly the crew suspect the squishy noises are not combat. Aspalex seems surprised, Akaanvaerd’s face has an odd expression and the Balor heart thumps fast and loud, for the crew an embarrassingly long time. The nautiloid disengages and seems happy to follow the battalion back to the parade grounds.

Back in the Plane of Fire, they set Lancers to guard the nautiloid, and berth Aspalex next to it for the night, sending a note to advise Jemina. She replies to say acolytes will come to them from the Red Wyrm Smelter in the morning to continue their work. They set their wards and watches and settle in for the night.

After midnight a group of half-dragon warriors and two robed figures attack Aspalex, with crossbows, a Cone of Cold, and banishing Thoric back to Blue Sky Mine in Corus Vale. Aargh leaps off the ship and lands on the mage concentrating on this spell, breaking it and the jann mage. Thoric is back in the Plane of Fire before he can finish greeting an old dwarven friend, and lays a circle of divine fury on the mercenaries below. The other mage is protected by a shimmering globe. Leon, Aargh, Virtu and Teririst cut through the rest like grass and Akaanvaerd breathes fire on them too. Aargh tries to shield the dying mage for interrogation with insufficient success.

Aargh looks too closely at the snake-like Y symbol of Demogorgon on the cultists pendant and starts hallucinating demons around him, swinging wildly through the,. Teririst finds this tempting and pockets them.

After this the night is uneventful.

Date X+105

Training continues in the morning with the Lancers and the party achieving mastery of the Charger feat.

Our heroes ponder what to do with a near extinct planar beast of burden, and whether they will have little baby lifeboats soon.

The Maidan and the Vent await, Leon itches for a dungeon crawl and Corus Vale remains at war …

Others have darker plans of course.
 

Session 42

After reviewing their situation, Thoric decides sending the Retriever to find another cultist wearing Demogorgon’s symbol would be a good idea. Standing in the middle of parade grounds near the ship and the nautiloid, the party watch as the retriever scuttles toward a nearby building. It doesn’t pause but goes straight up the wall and in an upper floor window. Some yelling and crashing is heard before it reappears dragging a cloaked figure who falls to the ground. The retriever climbs down at full speed and grabs the cultist without hesitation and drags it on its back across the field to the bemused party, just now realising they’ve been watched.
The cultist is shackled and questioned, resisting briefly before admitting they came from the Kalian, or smoke bazaar in the Rookery. Thoric sends the Retriever to get another symbol wearing cultist and it makes a beeline for the same building, before diverting round the back of the building at the last moment. Meanwhile the party debate the morality and risks of sending the cultist to the dubious mercy of the efreet, or of starting a more ethical prison camp at Starforge. As an armoured half-dragon cultist is dragged towards them by the retriever they release the first cultist on the overly convenient promise of good behaviour, who immediately plane shifts away. The second cultist offers only a fight, blasting them with flame breath before being crushed by Virtu, Teririst, Leon and Thoric.
Thoric send the Retriever for the first cultist, and it heads directly toward to the Rookery, which happens to be straight up and over the walls of the Palace grounds. The guards react with volleys of fire bolts, and the party launch into damage control. As they top the wall Thoric yells out, convincing some guards to hold off. Virtu Thundersteps right across the grounds to yell at the others, convincing the unimpressed guards of need for the chase. The Retriever looks worse for wear, but doesn’t stop on its mission.

The party give chase and catch up to the retriever as it climbs over walls and houses in a straight line to its goal, avoiding only the burning canals. Thoric gives it new instructions, suggest avoiding attention and being discreet. It immediately plane shifts. The party fly on towards the Rookery, bemused, with little time passing before they notice the retriever reappear directly below them. The party swoop in to catch a Cone of Cold as a welcome. Leon tests his new Charger feat, and the mage defends briefly before being crushed by hammer, mace, knife and spell.
The party send the Retriever, after healing it, to the cultists lair door by road this time and follow in the air.  It stops in the Kalian, where billows of smoke with different colours and amazing aromas drift around the bazaar. Thoric asks how many cultists are inside. The retriever taps its leg a dozen times in response. The party send it back to the safety of the ship.
Teririst goes invisible, unlocks the door and sneaks in past a sleeping guard. He checks the stairs carefully, finding every second step is trapped. He avoids them, and opens a door at the top to see three mailed guards and two robed cultists. The open door makes them suspicious and a mage casts Detect Thoughts, calling out Terirists intentions, which Teririst quickly tries to subvert into scaring them by thinking of blowing up the room. The other mage casts Detect Magic, outlining the invisible Tabaxi with a faint blue glow.

The mages gird themselves with spells. One of the guards tests a thought announced about disarming the traps by stepping on one, to send a crossbow bolt pinging off his greave. The sound alerts Leon, who pokes his head around the door to see a sleeping guard, and then look right into the eyes of the one on the stairs before shooting at him with a crossbow and ducking back behind the door. Virtu steps in and banishes both guards. Thoric charges up the stairs, setting off every remaining trap and dodging every single bolt, before emerging into the room to banish the two remaining guards too. Terrist chooses his moment to backstab a mage, his blue glow hidden by the mages own invulnerability globe. The party knock down the globes of invulnerability, a force wall, fire shield and break through stone-skin and mage armour to take down one mage and subdue and shackle the other. They briefly question it and obtain a quickly broken promise when the guards return from their banishment, as it yells "Warn the master!".  The guard at the bottom of the stairs runs outside and around the side of the building. Virtu sends DeeSix to follow, who reports it is climbing the back wall of the same building. The party manage to take out one of the guards and the other mage, with a booming alerting the remaining cultists who fling open the doors. 
Time seems to stop there - framing a tableau of the Ignan heroes surrounded, out-numbered and out-spelled …

Session 43
Three doors are flung open into the room, each revealing a muscle bound fiend fanatic with brass chains hooked  into the flesh of their shoulders. Their horns seem like vestigial tentacles sprouting from their heads. Behind the two of these on the left side of the room are two Archmagi, behind the gladiator on the right is a larger room with smoke pouring out filled with dancing embers. 
Time seems to pause as the mages mouth spells, globes of invulnerability appearing around them. Magic seems to reverberate and Thoric notes a strange bone feather quill stuck in the stairway wall in front of him, and a small pile of burnt brass coins on the table in the central room suddenly seems to leap into focus with the flame symbols on them seeming to dance. 
Time snaps back into normal flow and battle is joined like two waves crashing into each other. The mages seem shimmer a second ghostly head as they cast two spells at a time, creating hypnotic patterns to sow confusion with good effect. Thoric notices that his spells seem to echo too with one casting seeming to take effect twice and hitting a random target. Brass chains on the wall seem to leap to life, grappling Salmur and dragging him towards a brazier. The gladiator nearest lays into him and Salmur’s blood is drawn into the bottom brazier which then showers a fountain of flames all around it and back onto Salmur. 
Leon deals with the other gladiator, and moves onto the mage shielding behind it, who after taking a few hits teleports away. The remaining mage creates a wall of force to hide behind, but this doesn’t stop Thoric and Leon from porting in behind the wall to finish the cultist.
Thoric creates his own door through the brick wall into the last smoky room and enters to see a large two headed figure chained to a larger two-headed statue. Teririst notices more cloaked figures sneaking in the front door wearing a hand insignia with an eye in the middle.
The chained figure can be seen through swirls of smoke to be a large efreet, with a second head. The two heads can be heard arguing about duality and reality. Seeing Thoric they roar, "Who dares challenge the Maw of Brass?". One head spews fire, and the other radiates confusion, leaving Thoric befuddled. Meanwhile the new attackers move up the stairs, shooting lightning bolts toward Terrist who snipes at them while Leon stops them dead on the stairs, later helped by Salmur.
The previously escaped cultist reappears in a doorway near the Maw of Brass to shoot a thin green ray at Thoric, fortunately to no effect. One of the new cultists teleports away on seeing his partner cut down.
The party regroup to finish the Maw of Brass and the returned cultist, despite Thorics mind lashing and Terrist getting charmed. The Maw unchains itself from the statue and slams Thoric with brass gauntlets, and ghostly tentacles appear from the floor to hold some of the party in place. The party work together, Virtu, Terrist, Leon, Salmur and Thoric all contributing to take the aberrant efreet down, sinking into its own final confusion.
The last room contains a shrine with a demonic mask and a fang shaped brass dagger, and a simple brass chain hammock. A small chest is full of brass coins, fire opals and a brass plate scroll.
The party pause, wondering how long they’ve stopped Demogorgon’s rebuilding process for, and where the cultist of the eyed hand went …

Session 44
Terrist and Thoric team up to wrestle the writhing brass chains still one by one - Thoric grappling them, but sometimes getting tied up himself, while Terrist unbolts them from the walls. Thoric adjusts the chains links with a mending spell enough to slot them onto the immovable rod. Leon takes issue with the blood fueled braziers and smashes them into pieces, which ooze an oily black/red goo.
Thoric remakes the statue of Demogorgon into one of Moradin, with an uneasy feeling this could have great or terrible impact for the faith in the region, and that something more is needed. He decides a Hallow will cleanse the insane stain on the building and starts into a 24hr ritual. Virtu, Terrist and Leon set guard, and watch for an hour or so before deciding to reset the traps on the stairs, which shot bolts through a holes in the wall. Leon and Terrist look for passage ways and find none on the first floor. They go down and out the door to the Smoke Market to explore underneath, to find a brazier merchant. 
The shop is full of different styles of incense burners and lanterns, although nothing like the necromantic ones they just destroyed. Leon hesitates to ask anything telling, so Terrist sneaks into the back room past an old lady efreeta busying tinkering to find a secret door near the underside of the stairs. He drags the stone door open slowly, a little at a time to match the timing of street noise to find the empty crossbows and reload them. Repeating the process to leave takes just as long. Meanwhile Leon has a nasty thought that the Hallow in progress will stop all elementals entering the building, which includes the brazier shopkeepers as elementals entering their own shop on the ground floor of the building. Leon schemes to pose as an official advising of a gas leak and evacuation, and decides against it, returning to let Thoric know who stops the ritual.  He starts again, this time excluding the ground floor outside the secret trap room.
The watch resumes uneventfully, until Virtu catches the eye of a watchful efreet on a balcony diagonally across the street who quickly looks away and feigns interest in something else down the street. The watcher is wearing a brass mesh cloak, with a coin shaped Imix flame pendant peeking out. Another cloaked efreet with charcoal textured black skin sits on the balcony with a large hookah pipe between them leaking wisps of smoke. A tense watch-off ensues for a micro-eon, until Virtu sends an invisible DeeSix to see and listen through his ears. The Imix cultists are arguing in Ignan, and only pretending to smoke the hookah so Virtu borrows Thorics helm of languages to hear them complaining about dirty smoke and preferring clean fire. 
Leon goes back to the brazier shop to ask for the cleanest burning brazier they have. This gets an odd look from the merchant but he happily sells a bunsen style burner, and offers a gift wrapping service when asked to write a message about "clean burning flame". Terrist disguises himself as an efreet child and takes the parcel to knock on the door below the balcony. Virtu sees the cultists look surprised from his window, and one of them casting several spells on himself before going down to open the door. Terrist hands over the gift to see an angry reaction on reading the card, and he runs. The cultist drops a wall of force cube around the child-efreet-Terrist right in the middle of the market street to stop him still. Terrist steps into mist and into the ex-Demogorgon cult lair to drop down behind the window sill, followed by a fireball right at him and Leon. They look out to see the cultists back on the balcony arguing about the brazier, and ultimately using it.
Terrist sends three of the Imix coins floating over on a mage hand, which earns another fireball, and the ruined braziers which seem to be well received. The blackened cultist takes these down to the brazier shop and DeeSix oversees him asking for them repaired.
He then writes a message on a brass foil sheet, wraps it around a street cobble and tosses it through the window for Terrist to catch. Virtu uses the helm to read the Ignan message; "Did you kill the Imix faithful? Are you followers of Demogorgon?" Leon goes back to the shop to get another brazier and detailed explanatory message written back, which shocks the brazier merchant. His name is Ebougra Brook, and he appears very relieved to have the Demogorgon cultists and their maddening influence gone, and disturbed at what his wife is repairing. He writes the message and gives them the brazier and a free large mirror, while also asking them not to involve him any more. Terrist delivers this with a mage hand and fortunately the Imix followers seem satisfied with this, saying they are returning to their crucible. They stop into advise the merchant they’ll be back tomorrow to be told their business was unwelcome, which scruple was resolved with more money and some sharp and bloodied brazier spigots melted into a brazen puddle on the spot. The night passes quietly after this and Thoric chants on.
Morning blazes orange and gold, bathing the city with increasing heat and light to near the point of human tolerance. The Smoke market fills with a range of amazing and exotic smells.

Date X+106

The party plan for the Maidan race - Terrist is the obvious choice for the lead, with the rest of the party sweeping and blocking. They consider various tactics, ethical and otherwise, enhancing the Nightmares speed, protecting themselves and how the opposition could be defeated, delayed or disabled. Terrist and Virtu head back to the ship on the training ground to drop off the writhing chains. Jemina and her adepts make short work of stringing these along each side of the ship as an active boarding defence. The new ballista have been mounted and one is being converted into an Oaken Bolter.
Jemina suggests the Amaks as their best potential advisors for the Maidan, so Terrist and Virtu head straight for the Palazzo of the Blue Horse. Dalia welcomes them into the house, and asks after Leon and the party. She tells them both rules - no magic or flying, as well as what to expect from the last few races, noting enforcement is haphazard and in sight of the checkpoints only.
Terrist decides it’s time to go shopping for some magical horseshoes and potions. He visits the Golden Girdle first, to hear that horseshoes and similar are in high demand. He gets some Oil of Slipperiness and nearly convinces the shopkeep to sell him some reserved stock, but fails to come up with the necessary gold. He unwisely tries to sneak right in front of the shopkeep and is politely asked to leave. Terrist complies, disguises himself and returns only for the merchant to grab some fur poking out of his cuffs and again ask him to leave unless he has the money or trade goods. Terrist sneaks and dashes into the back room, and starts searching it only to have the merchant throw open the curtain and invisible hands attempt to grab him. Terrist leaves, and tries his luck at Afends Magic Emporium instead, this time disguised from the start as an Azer. Virtu tags along and looks around. The Azer-Terrist pockets a pair of wands, not noticing the handle-less door close behind him. Afend starts looking at each customer in the store suspiciously. Terrist palms a ring, and tries to slip it into another customer’s pocket but gets noticed with a few terse words, earning Afends attention sharply on both of them. Terrist puts the ring back and suggests to Virtu it’s time to go. Virtu tries the door, and sees no handle or lock, and turns to find an angry Afends right next to him. Virtu’s protestations of innocence rub the storekeeper the wrong way, and Afend yells at Virtu to empty his pockets right there.
Virtu complies, and Afend checks carefully before begrudgingly opening the door for Virtu to walk through. Terrist picks his moment and misty steps out to the street, with a cry of "Guard!" behind him. He quickly dashes into a side street and loses the disguise, relieved and elated with his new wands of magic missile and secrets. A memory of something useful for the race nags at him though, and he replays his heists bad and good in his mind for improvements in future escapades.
Meanwhile Thoric finishes the Hallow ritual, and a sense of clarity and focus returns to the Kalian. He thinks to himself - Surely  dwarves following Moradin work the smithies of the Street of Steel.

Afternoon settles lazily on the city, and the crowds buzz with talk about the race tomorrow.
Elsewhere the charcoal-faced Zazharr claims a win for Imix and implies and then angrily plays down notoriety for the party. 
A raven wing bone quill has written the name ‘Nihros the Ossuary’ on the back of a message scroll on a newly hallowed table.

Session 45
Terrist strikes out on his own to scout the racetrack. Starting at the Maidan, the track is being marked out with yellow bunting with guard posts every mile. After the end of the straight the track takes a left to curve around. Terrist goes far enough around to be out of sight and finds a straighter path, and then strides ethereally with Smoky Joe to go through the walls and canals. He finds a shimmering portal to the outer planes, and avoids it for now. 
Thoric and Leon finish hallowing the ex-Demogorgon cult lair and ask the lantern vendor Ebougra Brook downstairs to let them know if anything suspicious happens. They start their own walk of the track, and at the end of the Maidan straight see Terrist rejoining the track as well as a shady looking efreet watching him. Thoric approaches him and comments on his noticeable focus. The efreet shrugs and says "They say he has a Luck Blade. Nice belt you’re wearing. Where are you staying?". The conspicuously wealthy party wander along the track further with their obvious tail in tow. Terrist hides in waiting to sneak up behind the careless thief and pick his pockets, finding a notebook full of sketches of houses, floor plans, marking wards and alarms. Terrist flags down a guard, and showing them the book and convincing them with pointing and miming that the book belongs to the cocky thief. The unimpressed guard starts a shouting match in Ignan with the thief, who ultimately pulls something jingly out of his boot to give the guard, ending the matter to the guard’s satisfaction. The thief humphs at Terrist and moves off to continue tailing them, sometimes hiding successfully.
Terrist buys some paint in the market to mark out his path for tomorrow. Thoric and Leon find the magic shops calling them back and Leon after rubbing the shopkeepers the wrong way haggles a Sword of Answering down to reasonable price. This turns out to be on consignment from General Abd Multahib, who the store owner takes them to.
The General takes the sword out of a safe in his office and is pleased to sign it over to Leon for a set of diamonds. He asks if the party have registered for the race yet, and which army posting they would choose as their prize, suggesting they could establish an outpost in the Prime plane. The registration line is at the entrance of the Charcoal Palace - busy and short, so they join waiting Lancers and Angels and sign themselves and the nightmares up by name and pay the fee. They see another line outside full of lower class civilians, and ask their cavalry compatriots about it. "That’s for the Freedom Run. Any slave can race and the first across the line is freed. They start on foot in front of us, and we have to ride through them.". Thoric and Leon are mildly horrified and debate ways they could help one, some or all with little inspiration. One slave in the long line looks familiar, and Thoric asks how they know her. She answers "From the Blue Horse Palazzo sir. I’m racing so I can win my freedom and marry my sweetheart. Much cheaper than buying it.". Thoric pays her 1gp entry.
The party make their way back to the ship and prepare for the night, though with no spare spells to ward it. Hours pass quietly, until the new chains rattle loudly. The heroes leap out and find a pack of efreet thieves sneaking onboard.
Leon rushes in to test his new sword, finding it handy for ripostes, yet the pack tactics of efreet thugs surprisingly effective too. Thoric charges in to flip one backward over the railing, while Akaanvaerd blasts at something unseen still in the chains and snaps at anything near the bow. One efreet casts a spell seeming to bring a swarm of salamanders onto the deck, which Terrist pokes with his dagger to dispel the illusion. The fight goes toe-to-toe, with the heroes trading slashes while Terrist snipes at them from behind the mast. The fallen efreet bandit plane shifts away to presumably lick his wounds at home.
Another drops a wall of fire on Thoric and Leon, while the nearby nautiloid snakes tentacles over to help itself to the chained bandits as snacks. Thoric and Leon both push the thieves back to and grind them down until they also plane shift to safety before the Lancers rush in.
This night holds no more terrors, and the pre-dawn glow marks the time get to the starting line of the City of Brass’s most famous event held on the site of it’s very near defeat by Archmage Tzunk.

Date X+107

Glory awaits the winner, but is any prize worth the cost? Will the rules be followed?  What traps lie in wait?
