Elemental inner plane of pure earth. Mt Fundus is the largest mountain in the known multiverse, and one of the Pillars of Creation. Deep under the mountain lies the City of Gems, and under this the Dismal Delve and the Sevenfold Mazework.

City of Gems (City of Jewels)

Fifteen enormous geodes, or spherical air bubbles in the rock lined with crystals, form the fabled Dao, or earth djinn, capital. Where these geodes touch tangentially, passages have been bored through. Each geode has a spider’s web of ramps and bridges, and they all have different crystals encrusted their inner surface and different racial communities. The whole city cannot be seen at once from any viewpoint and it can be very confusing to navigate for visitors. The central Nexus is connected to 12 touching geodes and is the best vantage point, marketplace and melting pot of deep cultures.

The Dao rulers are ruthless and callous, yet confident enough in their power to allow nearly anyone in to trade (except yakmen). All gems are secretly and magically stamped as property of the Dao though and trying to leave with even one brings swift justice, the Dao’s favourite and only kind.

The city structure is two hexagonally close packed pyramids, one inverted so there is an uppermost and lowermost point, two layers of three adjacent to these, sandwiching a middle layer of 7. The inhabitants have adopted a combination of vertical level numbers and horizontal clock style references to identify the geodes. These are:

Plane of Fire

Elemental inner plane of pure fire. Map adapted from DMG p57. The Fountains of Creation volcano range, peaked by Valmont, erupts rivers of lava flowing down, around Isla Fuego into the Sea of Fire, where the lava ports Celsus and the City of Brass sit. The vast Cinder Wastes are a scorched desert occasionally blanketed by ashfalls or buffeted by ember storms. The Vent gapes in the middle like a drain to nowhere, with The Fissures seeming to point to it like sharp dry rivers of shadows. South of the Fissures at the cold old tail of the Foundations of Creation lies Starforge, a mostly dormant volcano with a crater lake, blaring a beam of light for hundreds of kilometres around. The Fireside Monastery is located halfway up it’s side, with the town of Redstone the base.

The City of Brass lies to the north end of the Cinder Wastes, along with the Azer village Arafalque, near Fireweed Forest. At the northeast corner is Fort Fang, a ruined outpost and mine, now quietly occupied by Feldspar. A little south of Ft. Fang is the Ash Dunes.

South of Starforge is the Plane of Earth, to the west of Isla Fuego the Plane of Magma, north of the Sea of Fire is the Great Conflagration, and to the east the Plane of Ash.

Starforge (Star Forge)

Ref: BPGOTG, D&D Beyond, “Giants of the Star Forge”

Giants built the Star Forge eons ago in a crater up the mountain that now bears its name, after the fallen star that formed the crater and that the founding giants harnessed to power a massive furnace. On a clear night, the light is visible for over 400 km.

The three locations in this region now operate under a joint “Starforge Council” established with the parties help.

Fireside Monastery

This is an ancient stone cloister about ten miles up the mountain from Redstone and five miles downslope from the Star Forge. Ascetics and mystics from all walks of life seek enlightenment here, including a significant number of firbolgs (Humanoids distantly related to giants). The Fireside Monastery’s most famous aspirants are hardy firbolg martial artists who call themselves giant wrestlers.

NPCs:

·      Diasma, LG Firbolg Wanderer. Senior Giant Wrestler. Put party through the Fireside Challenges, and trained party in Grappling after assisting in liberation of Starforge.

·      Dencka, Firbolg Giant Wrestler raised by Thoric after being crushed by a fire giant’s boulder in the liberation of Starforge.

·      Theldin Giltall, LN human smith, uncle of Evin. Kidnapped by Brimskarda and rescued by the party.

·      Captain Soot and the ship Ebony Queen make a trading stop here

Starforge (Star Forge)

The forge itself is located on an island in a crater lake at the top of the mountain. The lake is mildly acidic, the volcanic acidity kept low by a set of Giantish runic tablets on ancient glowing white columns with veins of glowing magma, repaired by the party. Akaanvaerd’s lair was under the forge, with the immense heat high enough to keep gold in molten pools.

A runic colossus, partly built by Brimskarda and a briefly enslaved Theldin, lies crudely disabled.

The meteorite is also a source of rare ores and metals, including Darksteel and adamantite. The forge is now operated by colonist dwarves of Thoric’s clan, with help from Theldin and Klepkin, the only known survivor of Akaanvaerd’s minions. Redstone is a key trade route stop for the party’s merchant agreements being halfway between the Cities of Gems and Brass, and also the closest thing they have to a planar base.

NPCs:

·      Brimskarda, LE Fire Giant Forgecaller. Captured Starforge from Akaanvaerd, abducted Theldin to help build a runic colossus. Brimskarda was killed by the party during Theldin’s rescue and liberation of Starforge. Sister of Zohelm.

In attempting to recapture Starforge, briefly allied with the party before breaking his word on underestimating and disbelieving the party. Killed at Starforge, and his scales and wings used to fireproof the airship Aspalex. Later reanimated and permanently melded into Aspalex by Felparizin, and bound to 10yrs service. Secret: now a dracolich.

·      Ephlon, young red dragon. Son of Akaanvaerd. Now dead after attempting revenge in the Cinderwastes.

·      Sonnlinor Thenkar, dwarven cleric and settler, originally from Blue Sky Mine

·      Klepkin, LE kobold smith, who hid from the fire giants

The Vent

A 1.6km wide and 1200m deep hole in the Cinder Wastes. The party noticed demons coming from that direction, and met a squad of Abishai hunting them. A giant portal to the Abyss sat at the bottom. The Sultan was notified and sent his Angels of Death and First Lancer cavalry units, along with azer and salamander infantry, to defend 6 miles of adamantium chain and hundreds of sorcerers casting Gate Seal as a ritual over 24 hours. The party flew with the Angels “Fireball 5” squadron until the battle when they patrolled the middle of the Vent in Aspalex with the dragon lauth and the Abishai wing.

The demons were routed, Demogorgon himself killed, and the gate sealed, revealing an active kimberlite volcano caldera, or diatreme, with a Scion of Surtr in the middle. A Fire Giant army surrounded the efreet and attacked without warning, to be beaten to only  10% of their original numbers with the help of opportunistic yugoloth mercenaries and a discovery of raw diamonds in from the volcano. The efreet army took heavy losses doing this including all infantry and mercenaries. The remaining cavalry and sorcerers decamped quickly to avoid the falling stones of the erupting volcano, taking the victory over the demons, and leaving the fire giants to their raging god-avatar-child.

Ref: Al-Qadim, Secrets of the Lamp, adapted to 5e and party level/plot.

Despite being the largest city, and bazaar, in the known multiverse, the City of Brass is mobile, all sitting in an enormous brass bowl which can levitate and move slowly in any direction. The city is home to over 4 million efreet, with many salamanders, azers, fire giants and more. It would shock no-one to see races from all over the planes here.

The following list of places is far from complete, simply listing areas the party has been or told of as being of interest directly.

The biggest race is the Sultans Steeplechase, where any mount can be used, although flying is forbidden.
